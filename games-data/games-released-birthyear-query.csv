With the galaxy divided into three distinct zones, the Galactic Police and the Culthorpe pirate family are engaged in a cold war from across the Lifeless Zone. Life has never been more dangerous for the people of the universe, doubly so for those who make a living flying from planet to planet. And to make matters worse, an invisible conspiracy is threatening life itself.

None of which means anything to Daniel Gordon, earthling and wage slave, whose major concern is keeping hold of his pension plan. That is until he is unexpectedly abducted by the galaxy's premier employment agency and finds himself stuck with a crew of misfit mercenaries on a cargo transporter built more like a skip with thrusters.

138526,299,Age of Empires III,"The story-based campaign mode consists of related scenarios with preset objectives, such as destroying a given building. In Age of Empires III, the campaign follows the fictional Black family in a series of three ""Acts"", which divide the story arc into three generations. All three acts are narrated by Amelia Black (Tasia Valenza).

Instead of playing as one of the standard civilizations, the player controls special civilizations linked to the character or period that each Act portrays: the Knights of St. John for Act I, John Black's Mercenaries for Act II, and the United States for Act III. Most player units speak English, with the exception of unique units such as Spanish Rodeleros and Lancers or German Uhlans and War Wagons.

Act I: Blood
In the late 16th century, Morgan Black—a Scottish-born mid-level commander of the Knights of Saint John— defends their last stronghold on Malta from the forces of Sahin ""The Falcon"" of the Ottoman Empire (in a telling of the Great Siege of Malta). When the Turks flee, Morgan and his superior Alain Magnan discover a stone library telling of the Lake of the Moon; the Fountain of Youth, a rumored source of eternal life; and a secret society called the Circle of Ossus, who seek the Fountain for their own gain. Alain orders Morgan to sail to the New World to search for the Lake, but Morgan is attacked by the pirate Elisabet ""Lizzie"" Ramsey and lands in the Caribbean islands. After re-engaging and defeating Lizzie, Morgan's men find some navigation charts and sail to New Spain. In Yucatan, Morgan's forces destroy an Ottoman base. However, Spanish conquistador Francisco Juan Delgado de Leon captures Sahin. Morgan then defends his new Aztec allies from the Spanish and learns Delgado was looking for the map to the Lake of the Moon, disguised as a town square mosaic. Morgan sets sail for Florida, but his fleet is damaged by a hurricane and docks in Havana, Cuba, where he earns Lizzie's respect and promises her the gold from the Spanish treasure fleet if she takes him to Florida.

In Florida, while Alain claims the lake, Morgan and Lizzie capture Spanish treasure ships and Sahin, killing Delgado in the process. Sahin tells Morgan that he only wanted to keep the Circle from claiming the Fountain. Alain orders Morgan to execute Sahin, but Sahin and Lizzie convince Morgan that Alain actually leads the Circle of Ossus. At the Lake of the Moon, the group captures an enormous stationary cannon called a ""Fixed Gun"" from the Circle. Using the Fixed Gun, Lizzie's fire ships and Morgan's ground forces hold off the Circle's elite Boneguard soldiers, kill Alain, and destroy the Fountain. After the battle, Sahin returns to Turkey, and Lizzie, having lost her Spanish gold, leaves for the Caribbean, although it is hinted she and Morgan will reunite. Morgan silently wonders whether they really found the Fountain of Youth, then refills his empty canteen with water from the lake.",2005-10-18 00:00:00.000,110,NULL,78.2500,5,79.0335,316

Centuries of destructive exploitation by a race long gone, reduced what was once a paradise into a world inhabited only by machines. Those machines, robots of all shapes and sizes, rebuilt Scrapland into an awe-inspiring metropolis of glittering greatness.

As the robots rebuilt the world they also created a new class of citizens: policemen, bankers, priests, and civil servants. This fledgling society was transformed dramatically by the discovery of a device dubbed “The Great Database”. With it the robots could easily revive any expired or nonfunctional automaton. Death became a thing of the past.

Against this backdrop you join the story of an outsider named D-Tritus who arrives at Scrapland amid a string of bizarre murders. D-Tritus lands a job investigating the killings and eventually becomes entangled in a web of conspiracy that only his quick wits and a little help from his friends will save him from.""",2004-11-04 00:00:00.000,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,68.7215,6

60552,5729,Area 51,"In July 1947, an alien spacecraft crashed near Roswell, New Mexico in the United States. The craft was recovered by the U.S. Air Force and taken to Area 51 in Nevada, where the lone survivor of the crash, a powerful Grey named Edgar, was held captive by the U.S. military. Eventually, the Greys opened a dialogue with the Illuminati led by the ominous Mr. White (Phil Proctor), and struck a deal with them. The Illuminati would give the Greys a research base 3 miles below the surface of Area 51, the use of the base as a landing site, and give them human test subjects where they, along with human scientists, would research a mutagenic virus to use in a war on their homeworld. In return the Greys would give the Illuminati exclusive access to Grey technology. The Illuminati used some of this technology to spy on the population.

The Greys and the human scientists eventually developed a powerful alien being - known as the ""Theta"", which spread the virus. Unbeknownst to many of the scientists working on the project, the Greys and the Illuminati were also planning to use the virus against the Earth population and dominate the planet. When Dr. Winston Cray found out about the plan, he let loose the ""Theta"" and the mutagenic virus throughout Area 51, in an effort to slow them down. This prompted the military to send in a Quick Reaction Force led by Major Bridges (Powers Boothe) to quarantine and contain the virus. HAZMAT Team Delta, the first team initially sent into Area 51 are ambushed by the ""Theta"" creature, sustaining casualties, before withdrawing deeper into the base.

A world sustained by the Great Spirit Mana and its elemental powers.
Every substance and object in this world is formed by the elements.
People lived under the protection and guidance of the Mana.
To the people of Regallzine Mana is exist as part of nature like the wind and trees.
However, there are a few select people capable of creating something out of nothing using the powers of Mana called alchemist.

Klein Kiesling age 17, grandson of Dafune a famous alchemist, embarks on a journey with Popo the Mana of wood, after his grandmother´s death, to surpass her as an alchemist.

Walking through the dark forest of South Esvior, Klein encounters a vicious monster. Klein bravely battles the monster, but his Mana strength slowly diminishes. When everything seemed lost, a beautiful young girl named Lita came to Klein´s rescue.

Lita is a monster hunter at the neighboring town of Kavok. She advises Klein that the path to Kavok is dangerous and he will need her help. Klein rejects her advice from his selfish pride, insisting that he will make it through the forest alone. After the two depart, Klein felt ashamed for not thanking Lita for her life saving help.

Exiting out from the forest, Klein stood on a cliff overlooking the great plains of Esvior. What he saw from the cliff was a city built upon a steep mountain. The city Klein saw is the infamous city to the Esviore region, known as the city in the sky, Avenberry.

Klein and Lita do not know yet,
that the two will knock on the gates of heaven,
opening the ancient path to the legendary 'city in the sky'.""",2004-05-27 00:00:00.000,4,NULL,82.5000,3,71.2734,9

Since earliest times the glorious clan of dwarves is standing guard over the subterranean world. And this work is hard and all-important indeed. Only the few know that all the worlds are connected to each other with secret passages. Most of these passages are underground, hidden from strangers' eyes. A casual traveler enters a cave as a shelter from bad weather, but we know it hides a gate to another world. A gate from where unbidden visitors may come. 
 
The dwarves are guarding the passage secret and keep peace in their world... And now the world shuddered. For the majority it is just a natural disaster. But we know: the world substance is torn, it's time to take arms, go down and stop the invaders. 
 
Your mission is to purge the dungeons from the evil and gather as much treasures as you can - it will take plenty of gold and diamonds to repair the seal on the Gate between the worlds. 
 
The Warrior and the Wizard are the greatest heroes of their people. What do you prefer - slashing steel or will-power? Make your choice and start your journey. 
 
Remember, the fate of many worlds depends on you...",2004-12-31 00:00:00.000,2,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Jason Donovan is the voice of Buzz in the UK and Australia. Different voice-actors are used across Europe for Buzz and Rose.
Players can choose from 16 different contestants to suit that persons personal music taste. These include a pop diva (Gina), a rocker (Phil), a punk, an Elvis (Pelvis) and a disco dude (Stevie). These characters resemble famous pop musicians such as Gwen Stefani, Liam Gallagher and Geri Halliwell and Bob Marley.
There are over 1,000 music clips, all of which are international chart-toppers from the 1950s through to 2005 and over 5,000 questions to test a players knowledge, either by playing solo in a fast paced single-player mode or with friends/family in the multi-player game. None of the music clips are original recordings.
Players can also choose to play in short bursts, or over a longer period. All wins and losses can be saved to Memory cards for players to refer to at a later date.",2005-10-21 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,80.0000,2,NULL,NULL

191681,2964,Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of The Earth,"Following the introduction sequence set in Arkham Asylum psychiatric hospital, the game begins on September 6, 1915, as police detective Jack Walters (voiced by Milton Lawrence) is summoned to a decrepit manor house in Boston, Massachusetts. The manor is inhabited by a small bizarre cult called the Fellowship of the Yith, led by one Victor Holt who has asked specifically for Walters to come and talk to him. Taking cover from an ensuing firefight, Jack finds himself separated from the police and trapped inside the mansion, with no option but to investigate. When the rest of the police finally break in, they find the cultists dead by mass suicide and Walters apparently insane. He is committed to Arkham sanatorium, where he stays for several years. 
Six years later, Walters is released and becomes a private investigator. On February 6, 1922, he takes up a missing person case at Innsmouth, a xenophobic coastal town, and the site of the recent disappearance of Brian Burnham, a clerk that had been sent there to establish a local store for the First National Grocery chain. Arriving in the isolated town, which appears to be depopulated and in a state of collapse, Jack unsuccessfully asks around for Brian. He stays the night at a hotel, where he barely escapes an assassination attempt and then flees from a chase by an armed mob. 
From that point forward, Jack is forced to sneak through the alleys, buildings and sewers of Innsmouth, avoiding murderous patrols of the town's corrupt police and the cultists looking for him. He acquires weapons to defend himself and meets undercover agent Lucas Mackey, who tells him that the town is under government investigation. Jack eventually finds Burnham and his girlfriend Ruth, but their car crashes when they escape from Innsmouth, killing Brian and injuring Jack (it is left unknown if Ruth was killed or not). 
Jack recovers from the incident and, following a brutal interrogation, he is taken in by the FBI, personally led by J. Edgar Hoover. On February 8, Jack helps Hoover and the FBI raid the Marsh Gold Refinery, where he is attacked by an ancient creature known as a Shoggoth and uncovers a Cthulhu shrine. The refinery is then demolished through the use of explosives. 
After the refinery raid, the U.S. military begins a combined land-and-sea invasion of Innsmouth on February 9. The only thing that proves problematic to the full scale assault is the headquarters of the Esoteric Order of Dagon, a religious organization centered on two undersea demigods and Cthulhu that holds the whole town under its grip. The building proves unbreachable for the Coast Guard and the Marines, but Jack finds a way in through an old smuggling entrance (guarded by a star-spawn of Cthulhu.) Inside, Jack frees Agent Mackey, who has been kidnapped for a ritual sacrifice, and puts down the magical shield protecting the building. After discovering a secret chamber, he falls through the floor of a tunnel which leads into the sea. 
Jack is rescued by the USS Urania, a Coast Guard cutter which is part of a group heading to Devil's Reef on February 10, following up on a lead provided by the FBI. On the way there, wizards on the reef summon powerful tidal waves to destroy the flotilla, but Jack commandeers the ship's cannon and kills them. The humanoid fish-men known as Deep Ones launch a massed attack on the Urania, killing most of the crew and disabling the engines. Jack manages to reactivate the engine only to have the gigantic Father Dagon himself attack him on the bow. Jack manages to defeat the demigod with the cannon, but not before it causes the Urania to sink. Jack survives the encounter and finds himself on Devil's Reef, where he discovers old smuggling tunnels beneath the seabed, leading him to the underwater city of Y'ha-nthlei. 
The city is found to be located below Devil's Reef and is the home of the Deep Ones and members of the Order. Navy submarines attempt to torpedo Y'ha-nthlei, but are stopped by a magical barrier protecting the city. The Temple of Dagon is the source of the barrier, but the entrance is sealed off to prevent any interference. Jack finds another way in through ancient tunnels feared by the Deep Ones at the bottom of the city's foundations. Apparently, this passage, which leads to the temple, is an ancient prison for flying polyps, the enemy of the Great Race of Yith. Jack manages to defeat them with the help of a Yithian energy weapon. Jack then enters the Temple of Dagon and kills Mother Hydra, whose song is generating the barrier, by deafening some of the Deep Ones to her song, allowing him to take control of them. With the barrier down, the submarines attack the city, while Jack escapes through a portal leading back to the Order's headquarters. 
In the end, it is revealed that a Yithian swapped minds with Jack Walter's father during the moment of Jack's conception. In flesh, Jack Walters is human, but he inherited Yithian psychic powers, which was the reason for the cultists' interest in him, and explains why he has visions of coming danger and of the Yithian library-city of Pnakotus, as well as his ability to control Deep Ones in the Temple of Dagon. Confined back into Arkham Asylum, Jack hangs himself on February 16, 1922, unable to handle the reality of himself and what he has witnessed. The game is supposed to be ""based on the writings in Jack's journal, which were discovered in 1924.""",2005-10-24 00:00:00.000,40,NULL,79.5000,3,78.9535,86

These Generals in Dracula’s army are Devil Forgemasters, which means they pal around with familiars that they can manufacture, then summon and dismiss at will.

The story goes that Hector betrayed Dracula in some way in response to objections about Dracula's actions, indirectly causing his defeat at the hands of Trevor Belmont. Ashamed at his own betrayal, Hector gives up the trade until Isaac, who remained loyal to Dracula, kills Hector's girlfriend Rosaly. A furious Hector chases Isaac to the ruins of the castle and the story of this game begins with the playing taking the role of Hector in his quest for vengeance.",2005-11-01 00:00:00.000,8,NULL,66.0000,2,73.9459,26

189078,6189,Cave Story,"The player character awakens in a cave with no memory of how he came to be there. He finds a village of Mimigas, who are being persecuted by the Doctor. The Doctor's servants Misery and Balrog are looking for Sue Sakamoto, a girl who had been transformed into a Mimiga. Not finding her, they mistakenly abduct another Mimiga named Toroko instead. The player finds Sue in the Egg Corridor, where she discovers the eggs of a Sky Dragon, which could allow her to escape the floating island if hatched. Sue attempts to rescue her brother Kazuma, but King, the leader of Mimiga Village, captures her and holds her responsible for Toroko's kidnapping. Sue tasks the player with retrieving Kazuma from Grasstown. After freeing him, they meet Professor Booster, who reveals that the Doctor plans to use the red flowers on Mimigas to create an army to take over the surface world. Booster sends the player to the Sand Zone to destroy the red flowers before the Doctor can find them. While there, the player meets Curly Brace, a female robot who also has no memories of her past, and Jenka, an old witch who is Misery's mother and guardian of the red flowers. Jenka calls the player character a ""soldier from the surface"", one of many who were sent to the island to slaughter the Mimigas.

Misery transports the player to the Labyrinth deep inside the island as punishment for interfering with the Doctor's plans. Curly Brace has also been thrown into the Labyrinth and they cooperate to escape. Balrog helps them to move the boulder blocking the exit, revealing his kind nature. The pair find and defeat the Core, a magical creature whose power keeps the island afloat. However, the Doctor steps in to save it before the island collapses. Depending on certain conditions, the player may rescue Curly Brace, who had sacrificed her air tank to save the player character. When he returns to Mimiga Village, he finds that the Doctor has captured the Mimigas. In the Egg Corridor, Kazuma offers the player a choice to escape the island with him using a Sky Dragon, leading to an alternate ending in which the Doctor conquers the surface world while Kazuma and the player hide in the mountains. The player may instead choose to confront the Doctor and destroy the island's Core, which would return the Mimigas to normal. The player scales the outer wall of the island to reach the Plantation where the Doctor is using the Mimigas as slave laborers to grow red flowers. The Doctor's servants capture him and place him in a jail cell with Sue. She is taken away before the player wakes up, but her letter reveals that the Doctor was a member of the research expedition that included Sue's family and Professor Booster, but he betrayed them once he found the Demon Crown. Sue directs the player to find her mother who may have a plan to stop the Doctor.

If the player saved Curly Brace earlier, the player may find an item to restore her memories. She remembers that the player character's name is Quote, and that they were not the killer robots who slaughtered Mimigas in the past. Instead, they were sent to destroy the Demon Crown to prevent its power from falling into the wrong hands. Quote finds Sue's mother, Momorin, who is building a rocket that will allow access to the top of the island where the Doctor resides. After helping her complete the rocket, Quote confronts Misery and the Doctor. The Doctor has purified the essence of the red flowers into a crystal, which allows him to survive even after Quote destroys his body. The Doctor's spirit possesses the Core of the island, but Quote succeeds in destroying that as well, causing the island to begin falling to Earth. Under certain conditions, the player may proceed into a bonus stage called the Bloodstained Sanctuary where the creator of the Demon Crown, Ballos, is imprisoned. Ballos, Jenka's brother, was a powerful wizard who went insane after being tortured. Misery forced Ballos to create the Demon Crown, but she and Balrog became cursed to serve whoever possessed it. With the help of Curly Brace, Quote defeats Ballos and stops the source of the negative energy that was causing the island to fall, saving its inhabitants. Balrog saves the two before they are crushed by Ballos' collapsing prison—he had been sent by Misery as thanks for breaking her curse. Quote, Curly Brace, and Balrog leave the island to live out their days in peace.",2004-12-20 00:00:00.000,35,NULL,83.0000,3,85.0936,79

This system, despite coming to a halt years ago, keeps on expanding itself due to the way it was built, and recently, has been getting attention for having hackers break into its deeper sectors in search of fame and profit by selling classified data found within the system. However, this is not the hacker's paradise, a rumor has it that those who dare invade go deep into the system can contract the ""Achiba Syndrome"", which keeps the user's mind trapped inside the simulation for eternity.",2005-06-23 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,50.0000,1,NULL,NULL
124837,11749,Codename: Gordon,"Codename: Gordon presents an alternative to the storyline of Half-Life 2, with locations inspired by both Half-Life and Half-Life 2. Along the way, Gordon Freeman — the protagonist from the canon games — meets with some of the main characters of the Half-Life series and tries to find what caused the disappearance of the third dimension.
The game starts with Gordon Freeman in a dock area. After making his way through a few zombies and headcrabs, Gordon meets with Barney Calhoun, a prominent character in the later Half-Life titles. He tells Gordon of an ""entire dimension"" missing and also notes that the science team is working on solving the problem. Being injured, Barney cannot leave the place, so he gives Gordon his pistol, telling him to leave without him.
In the second chapter, the player meets with Eli Vance and his daughter Alyx who tell Gordon to take their car, which will help him reach City 17, as seemingly it is the center of the problem. They also tell him to talk to Dr. Kleiner, about his new invention, the gravity gun. Soon after, the player finds Dr. Kleiner, who tells Gordon about his worries regarding the missing dimension and also gives him the gravity gun mentioned by Eli and Alyx.
After being attacked by an alien gunship and getting past a prison heavily guarded by Combine soldiers, Gordon manages to reach City 17, where he finds the G-Man. He tells the player he has been expecting him and claims to not be behind the situation regarding the missing dimension, instead he says he is but a ""lowly pawn in a shady game being played by sinister powers"". Soon after, Gordon confronts a strider — a large tripod assault unit — which turns out to be the source of the problem, as upon defeating it a portal is opened; stepping into this portal, Gordon is sent back to the third dimension.",2004-05-17 00:00:00.000,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,69.6844,7

122397,5781,Cold War,"It's 1986, and the United States and the Soviet Union are taking the first tentative steps toward perestroika - a sense of friendship and cooperation that has not existed between the two world superpowers for decades. It appears that the Cold War might actually be over.

Unfortunately, not everyone thinks that glasnost is a good thing. A fundamentalist faction within the Soviet government doesn't want the Cold War to thaw - they want it to heat up. Led by Barinsky, the radical head of the KGB, a group of separatists is making a last, desperate attempt to return the USSR to the control of the hard-line Communist regime by framing an American in a plot to assassinate the Soviet president and set off a chain of events that could very well lead to World War III.

Matthew Carter, a hard-nosed American journalist following a tip from an informant, has just arrived in Moscow to cover a story. He is hoping that this assignment will lead to the story of a lifetime. Instead, it leads him into the thick of Barinsky's plot. Now, instead of vying for a Pulitzer Prize, Carter is fighting to clear his name, get to the bottom of Barinsky's sinister plan, and - hopefully - get out of the Soviet Union alive.",2005-09-27 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,56.0000,2,50.0000,2

39945,52303,Country Justice: Revenge of the Rednecks,"Country Justice begins with an unnamed Hick observing a river slowly being tainted with a line of green ooze originating from a nearby pipeline. The next day, Steve Earl, a Redneck living in the fictional valley of Yahoo, is confronted by his wife (and sister) about the mysterious disappearance of their goat, Dixie. She hypothesizes that their goat was kidnapped by the Hatfield brothers, who have a strong disdain for both Earl and his wife. Earl sets out to find his goat. 
 
Noticing his truck's key has gone missing, he stops by his friend Skeeter's house to find them. Along the way, Earl must fend off against zombies and mutant animals. He reaches Skeeter's house and finds his keys shortly after having to deal with Skeeter's incoherent rambling. Earl heads over to the Hatfield's farm, which is being overwhelmed by zombies. After the Hatfields' are dead, Earl raids their farm only to find Dixie absent. After leaving the barn, he finds his truck missing and is approached by Sheriff Cletus. After getting back into his car, Earl is told to go through a nearby nuclear power plant. 
 
Going through the powerplant leads Earl to a town where he's locked up by a police officer, in order to keep him from being infected. He escapes prison shortly afterward and steals a boat that the officer tipped him off to. Earl then proceeds to go to a facility described by the officer, in which he fights against zombie security guards plaguing the facility. Eventually, Earl is led to a room where he finds a mad scientist using Dixie to make himself invincible. Earl quickly foils his plan, killing the scientist before rescuing Dixie. Earl then returns home with Dixie to his wife, elated that he finally found their goat. 
 
After exiting his trailer, Earl is met by three lines of text that are bunched together in a way that makes them difficult to read. The following (as displayed in the screenshot) reads: ""Congratulations Steve! You saved Yahoo country from the mad scientist! You are now invulnerable!"".",2005-02-07 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

152285,5808,Darkwatch,"The game's story (narrated by Peter Jason) follows the exploits of Jericho Cross, an outlaw-turned-vampire, and his employment in an ancient vampire-hunting order known as the Darkwatch.
After unwittingly releasing the Darkwatch's greatest enemy, a vampire lord named Lazarus Malkoth, Jericho is conscripted into the Darkwatch as an elite operative. Jericho, however, is slowly turning into a vampire himself, after being bitten by Lazarus. The game outlines either Jericho's struggle for humanity or his descent into darkness, depending on the player's actions. The game begins in Arizona Territory in 1876 with Jericho attempting to rob a Darkwatch train that is transporting the captured Lazarus Malkoth to the Darkwatch Citadel, a frequently mentioned and often visited location in the game, and in doing so releases Lazarus into the West. In a seeming bit of mercy, Lazarus bites Jericho and gives him the curse of the vampire, causing him to slowly turn into one. The game continues with the introduction of Cassidy as well as the appearance of Shadow, Jericho's undead horse. As the game progresses, Jericho finally makes his way to the Darkwatch Citadel, where he meets General Clay Cartwright, the current leader of the order. Cartwright puts him through Torture Maze, the Darkwatch initiation exercise which was designed as a test for Darkwatch Regulators, but Jericho gets a special version specially designed by Cartwright to kill him.
When Jericho passes the test anyway, he begins to do missions for the Darkwatch. Missions include tasks ranging from fixing some of the damage he has caused to acquiring Darkwatch equipment, such as the Darklight Prism, a stone that allows vampires within its vicinity to use their powers and walk in sunlight.",2005-08-16 00:00:00.000,8,NULL,69.0000,4,75.5200,15

Instead of reducing him to dust as it could easily have done, the dragon bowed down before the young knight and swore loyalty to him.

Months passed by and Rykke met Helsephine, a young enchantress, and fell madly in love with her. When he introduced Helsephine to Bolgrot, Rykke would never have guessed what was about to happen. The dragon, mad with rage, killed the sweet Helsephine and flew away, destroying everything on its way.

Rykke chased the dragon into his cave. When he found it, the old friends confronted each other in a titanic fight. Using his weapons and magic, Rykke succeeded bringing Bolgrot down. But fatally injured, the young hero died short after.

Looking for an explanation about the sudden violence of Bolgrot, the wise men of Amakna discovered within the entrails of the dragon six unusually colored eggs that were called DOFUS. Later on, it was discovered that when these eggs were reunited their power was absolute. Absolute, but also unstable. The wise men decided to conceal those terrible relics from the rest of the world.

During the following centuries, the secret of the existence of the DOFUS was so well kept that people eventually forgot all about them. But a cursed day among others, the guardians of the secret discovered that the DOFUS had disappeared. The news quickly spread, arousing terror and covetousness. It didn't take long for adventurers to show up in Amakna, attracted by the prospect of glory or plunder.

Rool, aboard his vessel, The Flying Krock, commands his minions to invade the island and take Donkey captive so that his next attempt at stealing the banana hoard will not be a failure and the hero will never mess with his plans again. Donkey, still lounging, did not notice the attack until Kutlasses ambushed him and took him prisoner. Kaptain K. Rool assures Donkey Kong that he will never see his precious island or his friends again.

Later and back on the island, Diddy, Dixie and Cranky Kong find Donkey missing, along with a note. It reads:
Hah-arrrrh! We have got the big monkey! If you want him back, you scurvy dogs, you'll have to hand over the banana hoard!
Kaptain K. Rool
At this point, Wrinkly, Funky and Swanky Kong come to the scene. Cranky suggests to give up the hoard, but Diddy insists that Donkey Kong would be furious if he lost his bananas after all trouble recovering them at the last time. Diddy and Dixie Kong ride to Crocodile Isle via Enguarde the Swordfish, and then start their quest.",2004-06-25 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,70.0000,1,NULL,NULL

However, several days pass without their return, and Dixie knows something is up. She takes matters into her own hands, and made her way to the southern shores of Donkey Kong Island, to the Northern Kremisphere, a Canadian and northern European-inspired landmass. There she meets Wrinkly Kong, and Wrinkly confirmed that the Kongs had passed by. Dixie then makes her way to Funky's Rentals.

The various characters are each unlocked by completing a required task within Dragon Universe (for example, Dr. Gero is unlocked by defeating Dr. Gero with Yamcha in the Androids Saga).

The Dragon Universe has a high level of replayability due to events in the game potentially changing from playthrough-to-playthrough. For example, in Goku's first playthrough the majority of the story proceeds as it does according to the anime. However, in the following playthroughs, certain choices can include Goku's fight with Frieza changing into a fight with Cooler instead. These choices can even lead to events such as fighting Broly and Omega Shenron after fighting Super Buu.

172826,674,Dungeons & Dragons: Dragonshard,"Dragonshard takes place in the world of Eberron. In the creation myth of Eberron, the dragon Khyber warred with his sister Siberys and shattered her body to pieces. In his anger, Khyber's brother Eberron wrapped him in his coils, trapping Khyber. The bodies of the three dragons became the three parts of Eberron's world: the surface Eberron, the Ring of Siberys that encircles Eberron, and the underworld of Khyber. The three world parts produce dragonshards, crystal and rock fragments imbued with magic power.

The Heart of Siberys is the largest dragonshard in Eberron. When it fell from the Ring of Siberys to the continent of Xen'drik, it created a storm-swept mountain range known as the Ring of Storms and caused a city to sink into the earth. Its immense magical force caused the natural creatures of the Ring of Storm to evolve into the Lizardfolk. To this day, the Heart draws factions into conflict over control of its power.

In addition to the playable races, Eberron is populated by a number of neutral non-player factions and creatures, including the illithids, longtime foes of the Umbragen, a host of golems constructed by an extinct elven race, ettins, and thri-kreen.

Dragonshard is the first video game set in the D&D campaign setting of Eberron. Eberron's creator Keith Baker wrote the storyline for Dragonshard. However, some discrepancies exist between the game and the canonical Eberron Campaign Setting. Siberys dragonshards should be gold in color, but they are blue in the game. Building new warforged is forbidden under the Treaty of Thronehold that ended the Last War — the only sources for new warforged are Merrix d'Cannith's illegal forge in Sharn and the Lord of Blades' forge in the Mournland.

The gods withdrew from the world in retaliation for mortal incursions into their planes. On Norrath itself, Dark Elves and the Orcs destroyed much of Faydwer; while the Ogres, Goblins, Orcs, and Giants ravaged Antonica. Transport and communication to the moon Luclin were cut off. The storyline says that 100 years ago, the continent of Antonica was ripped apart into smaller islands, which are now called the Shattered Lands. The oceans became impassible, preventing contact between the continents of Norrath. Fifteen years ago, the moon Luclin exploded, and parts of the shattered moon remain in the sky.

EverQuest II is set in what is called the ""Age of Destiny"" on the world of Norrath, 500 years later than the setting of the original EverQuest. The game world has been drastically affected by several cataclysms (see Story, above) since the original EverQuest. The planes have closed, the gods temporarily left, and the moon Luclin has been destroyed (and partially rained onto the face of Norrath). Remnants from the original EverQuest's Norrath can be found throughout the Shattered Lands. Players can ride trained griffons on predetermined routes over the Shattered Lands, or acquire a horse, flying carpet, warg, rhino or a floating disk so that they can travel more swiftly throughout much of the game world.",2004-11-08 00:00:00.000,2,NULL,80.6667,3,50.0000,3

178788,521,Fable,"On his sister's birthday, a young boy's village of Oakvale is raided by bandits; killing the boy's entire family. An old Hero, Maze, rescues the boy, seeing great potential in him; Maze trains the boy to become a Hero at the Heroes' Guild. Years pass; after honing his skills, Maze informs the Hero of a blind seeress living among a bandit camp near Oakvale, and advises the Hero to infiltrate the bandit camp. To the Hero's surprise, the blind seeress is actually his older sister Theresa who was taken in by Twinblade, a former Hero and the present Bandit King. After a showdown with Twinblade, the Hero is given the choice of killing or sparing the bandit.

Later on in the Hero's life, after he has gained more recognition among the people of Albion, he is invited to fight in the Arena, where he meets the legendary Hero named Jack of Blades, who runs the arena battles. As a final challenge, Jack pits the Hero against his rival, which was also once his childhood friend/room-mate back in the Guild - Whisper; when the Hero defeats her he may kill or spare her.

The Hero learns that Jack of Blades himself destroyed Oakvale during the Hero's childhood; aided by Theresa, the Hero discovers his mother alive in Bargate Prison. The Hero is captured in the rescue attempt and spends a year or more in the prison before finally escaping. Maze is revealed to be a traitor and working with Jack. Maze kidnaps Theresa. After defeating Maze, the Hero is led into a final confrontation with Jack where his mother is killed. Jack reveals that The Sword of Aeons can only be wielded if it receives the blood of Archon. The Sword of Aeons is said to be a very powerful sword of destruction. Upon the death of their mother, the Hero and Theresa are the only two remaining descendants of Archon, and if Jack destroys them both the sword will be even more powerful. After defeating Jack, the Hero must choose whether to keep the Sword of Aeons by killing his sister, or cast it away forever into a portal created by Jack of Blades' death.

Depending on the Hero's alignment and the player's choice of using or destroying the sword, there are a total of four different endings. Once the ending credits roll, players can resume their games.

In The Lost Chapters special edition, the story continues. After the defeat of Jack, the Hero must find passage to the Northern Wastes to aid a legendary hero named Scythe in stopping an unknown great evil from returning. Should the hero have discarded the Sword of Aeons he will have the opportunity to gain the sword ""Avo's Tear"", a sword of similar design and equal power but that holds a light alignment rather than dark. Avo is said to be a god that represents the light side alignment. After a series of quests revolving around this new evil, it is learned that Jack of Blades has returned. He must then defeat Jack of Blades a second time, Jack having returned from the dead in the form of a dragon. Upon the death of Jack, the hero then uses Jack's mask to capture Jack's soul, with Scythe telling him that the battle is not over and that he must destroy the mask. The hero then has the final choice of putting on the mask - being consumed by Jack in the process - or destroying it, along with Jack, forever.",2004-09-14 00:00:00.000,84,NULL,90.0000,3,84.1685,230

119893,1506,Front Mission 5: Scars of the War,"The plot of Scars of the War revolves around USN soldier Walter Feng. When Huffman Island is deemed ready for colonization by the United Nations in 2065, Feng becomes one of the island's first immigrants. Living in Freedom City, Walter befriends two other children - Randy O'Neill and Glen Duval. The three boys experience first-hand the realities of war during the outbreak of the 1st Huffman Conflict in 2070; Walter and Glen are literally scarred by shell casings during a battle in Freedom City. The three boys were separated at the end of the war when the USN forcefully repatriates Walter and Randy, and Glen is forcefully repatriated by the OCU. The three reunites during a peacekeeping operation as soldiers for their respective armies during the Huffman Crisis in 2086. Upon seeing Glen pilot a wanzer, Walter and Randy sign up for the USN Army's wanzer training program. As tensions between the OCU and USN elevate to a new high from the Larcus Incident, the two men qualify as wanzer pilots.

However, on the same day they qualify, Walter and Randy are sent off to fight in the 2nd Huffman Conflict. During the invasion of Freedom City, they encounter Glen in the suburbs of city and defeat him. Feng and O'Neill visit Duval before he is shipped off to a POW camp. A year later, the three face off again on the battlefield - this time, Glen easily defeats his friends. However, instead of showing mercy, Glen kills Randy inside his cockpit block. A ceasefire between the OCU and the USN is declared shortly after he escapes. Traumatized by the experience, Walter cleans up Randy's quarters in an attempt to move on with life. Seeing an application form for the Strike Wyverns assault unit, Feng signs the form and undergoes intensive training. He passes the test and joins the unit, where he meets his old friend Edward Collins and new commanding officer Lynn Wenwright (who happens to be his childhood sweetheart).

Over the next few years, Walter participates in numerous military operations and begins to take an interest in the conflicts he gets involved with. From Zaftra's struggles involving natural resources to pro-independence movements in the OCU, Feng gets drawn into a global war between nationalism and globalization that has been on-going for decades. At the heart of this conflict is the Grimnir - a terrorist organization aimed at destabilizing the supranational unions and return to a world governed by nation-states.",2005-12-29 00:00:00.000,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

In Resembool, Edward and Alphonse meet an enigmatic alchemist named Jack Crowley and an entity called the Phantom. It seems that they have some connection with both the disappearances and the strange creatures (known as Golems) appearing around the countryside. When sends the brothers and to investigate a village plagued by these monsters, they meet Arlen Glostner, an archaeologist who is studying the ancient civilization of Lebis. Edward and Alphonse soon find themselves headed for the ruins of Siam-Sid, the capital city of Lebis, to discover the truth behind the Golems and the puzzling disappearances.",2004-09-22 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
118864,57443,Fullmetal Alchemist 3: Kami o Tsugu Shojo,"The setting is Valdolla, a large city completely surrounded by snow-capped mountains.Edward, Alphonse, and Winry meet Sophie Belkman, a fourteen year old girl with silver hair and light blue eyes who has been cornered by Leonid, the guardian of ice. When Edward's attempt to save her from him fails, she uses a strange power causing a blinding golden light to light up the entire sky. 
 
Afterward, Leonid retreats, and Sophie passes out. The trio run to her aid. Soon after they've learned each others names, Sophie takes Edward and Alphonse and presses her seal, (A transmutation circle shaped like a flower) onto Edward's right hand, and Alphonse's shoulder, increasing their alchemic abilities. 
 
They sought out the Guardians of Ice, Wind, Earth, and Fire to get closer to solving the mystery of Velza. During this time, they progress through an ancient castle, where on the balcony, Sophie experiences strange pulsations accompanied with voices that make her scream. A strange transmutation circle is inscribed in the ground right by a rock-like platform that has handcuffs hanging down from chains to suspend someone. 
 
Ahead, the balcony overlooks the mountains. Sophie and the Elric brothers are surprised by Romeo Craigin, who are then taken into Custody by Venus Rosemaria and her subordinates Izzy Trigger and Boris Hammer. Edward yells for Sophie to escape. Alphonse is strapped to an Electrical machine for testing, and Edward stripped and locked in a cold jail cell with nothing but his boxers to stay warm, but Edward finds a way out and they escape the military base together. 
 
Upon fighting and defeating three of the four guardians twice, the brothers discover that they lose their power, and wither away into dust. Sophie saves Leonid who has been lifted from his curse, but is only shot and killed by Romeo Craigin moments after the trio leave the area. The brothers' journey finally comes to a close after reaching the highest level in the Shrine of Velza, where they find Sophie who has been possessed by Velza because of the red rock that Zelgius placed in her chest, and break her out of the trance. 
 
They fight Velza as a disgustingly ugly and enormous monster with a skull for a face. Upon defeating Velza, she gets sucked into the ground but re-emerges again in a human form covered with blood and glowing eyes, creating a massive vortex of wind and red light in her rage. Sophie approaches her, and despite the fact that Velza attacks her twice, she still survives almost unharmed (except for some bleeding on her forehead). Sophie then wraps her arms around the angry Velza, crying, and her words cause Velza to calm down, and she hugs her in return. Her eyes are shadowed out, but a tear falls and lands on Sophie's face where she begins to wither to dust. Her gentle eyes are revealed for a split second, and her last word being a ""thank you"" before vanishing for good. 
 
Afterwards, all of the monsters that were summoned when Zelgius initially placed the red stone in Sophie's chest, vanished as well, leaving citizens and military soldiers alike thankful and relieved that the terror was finally over. Zelgius, who is standing on the balcony with Roy Mustang notices that everything's vanished, and after saying his final farewell, he sets himself on fire and disappears into the air. They return to the Church to find Winry and Sophie's beautiful white cat, Norn, and decide to have a nice walk in town since they no longer had anything to worry about. 
 
On the way through the empty streets, Edward is pushed back by Winry, as she is deeply immersed in a conversation with Sophie, which causes him to fall behind the other three. In a shadowed alley, Toriga stands covered with a blanket, muttering and holding a large dagger. He has gone insane from his friends death by the flying monsters. The moment Edward reaches the alley, with his friends far ahead, Toriga lunges out and stabs Ed in the chest, then walks away, causing death on impact. 
 
Alphonse, Sophie, and Winry turn around after hearing a thump from behind them and run to Ed's side, crying in shock. After seeing Ed lying motionless, Sophie decides to use her power to bring him back to life. She places her hands over the wound in his chest and a light starts glowing. She meets Edward (who is floating upside down) in a beautiful looking place with a sunset on one side and the daylight on the other and talks with him. Edward screams her name out before she vanishes, and realizes that he's alive again (reaching out for Sophie). 
 
When he turns, he sees Sophie sitting with a blank and vacant expression, and Winry sobbing uncontrollably by her side. He then suddenly realizes that something is wrong, and moves to her, screaming and touching foreheads together. Edward and Alphonse meet Führer Bradley at the Headquarters which turns into a fight, where winning or losing will change the ending. 
 
Upon losing the battle, Edward is struck unconscious by Major Alex Louis Armstrong where he and Mustang speak with the Führer, who then enters the HQ and kills Romeo Craigin. Winry and the Elric brothers try to speak to Sophie who is vacantly staring out the window not even aware of their existence. They leave Valdolla in grief and sorrow. 
 
Mustang and Hawkeye are treated for injuries at the Hospital. At the very end, Norn continually meows trying to get Sophie to come back to reality, and just when hope seems lost, Sophie stresses out the words ""Norn"" and ""Ed"" with a smile. 
 
If you win the battle the scene with Norn still plays out but she runs from the hospital to the train station, recovered. Although she first believes her friends have already left, she succeeds in reuniting with the gang.",2005-07-21 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

The dark and chaotic twilight of the “Age of Tower” ended for this world called Stellamund and it entered the prosperous “Age of Crown”. But the wizards who triggered the great war during the Age of Tower no longer hold the power they used to have, and quietly researched the great magics that were lost, in a magical academy called Grimoire.

This is a story expanding three years of an extraordinary great wizard who was born in such age, the girls who become his pupils, a ruin from the old age, “Black Tower” that they live in, and the people that gather around them.

The main character Domino became the 9th great wizard of the Grimoire Academy. It was a very special case for a young wizard to be so successful, but Domino soon grew tired of the Grimoire. The other great wizards were only seeing magic as means for personal success than an important research. The research of magic has been put off and all they were doing was fighting over authority.

Domino left the capital and decided to live by himself in the sealed Black Tower on the frontier, rumored that a great wizard in the Age of Tower lived. But the other great wizards didn’t think well of that and gave him a test.

That test was to “Raise a full fledged wizard within three years”. Normally it would take decades to raise a proper wizard. On top of that, the two students that he was suppose to look after, Aria Vancliff and Kaya Xavier, were two of the most troublesome girls in the academy.

Flashbacks reveal that he was once a successful captain in the Spartan army and led his men to several victories before being defeated by a barbarian king. Facing death, Kratos called on the God of War, Ares, whom he promised to serve if the god would spare his men and provide the power to destroy their enemies. Ares agreed and bonded the Blades of Chaos, a pair of chained blades forged in the depths of Tartarus, to his new servant. Kratos, equipped with the blades, then decapitated the barbarian king.[23]

Kratos waged war at the behest of Ares, eventually leading an attack on a village occupied by worshipers of Athena. Ares had secretly transported Kratos' wife and child to the village; during his frenzied attack on its temple, Kratos accidentally killed them. Although Ares believed this act would free Kratos to become the perfect warrior, the Spartan instead renounced his pledge of servitude to the god. The oracle of the destroyed village cursed Kratos by bonding the ashes of his dead family to his skin, turning it ash-white and earning him the nickname, ""Ghost of Sparta"".

176530,1632,GoldenEye: Rogue Agent,"At the start of the game, a recording by M (head of MI6) reveals that: ""Three years ago, while on assignment, the agent was severely wounded in an encounter with Dr. No and subsequently lost the use of his right eye. Consumed with vengeance, he frequently resorts to violence and brutality, and is no longer fit for service with MI6."" According to the account, Dr. No shot the agent in his right eye during a mission.
Three years after the incident that claimed the agent's right eye, he is evaluated through a holographic simulation in which he is paired with 007 to stop Auric Goldfinger, a member of a criminal organization, from detonating a suitcase nuke inside Fort Knox. He fails the test and is held directly responsible for the ""death"" of 007. Charged with ""reckless brutality,"" he is dismissed from MI6. As he leaves the headquarters, he is seen reading an offer by Goldfinger to enlist in his organization.
The agent accepts Goldfinger's offer and is recruited as his enforcer, meeting with him at Auric Enterprises, where Goldfinger's scientists have developed a weapon known as the OMEN (Organic Mass Energy Neutralizer), which releases energy capable of breaking down organic matter on a nearly atomic level, resulting in disintegration. For his job of eliminating Dr. No, a fellow official of the criminal organization who has declared war on Goldfinger's branch of the organization, he is given a gold-hued cybernetic eye created by Francisco Scaramanga, another official of Goldfinger's organization (from which he receives his codename ""GoldenEye""). Scaramanga provides upgrades for the eye, starting with MRI vision. At Hong Kong, GoldenEye has to get a sniper rifle to take down Dr. No with the EM hack feature. At the Midas Casino, GoldenEye has to get to the vault (which can be found in multiplayer) to protect the OMEN with the magnetic polarity shield. At the Hoover Dam, GoldenEye has to destroy the dam and kill Xenia Onatopp. GoldenEye also tosses Oddjob over a rail into a pit inside the Hoover Dam after he betrays and attacks GoldenEye for unknown reasons. At The Octopus, GoldenEye has to download the navigation coordinates to Crab Key (Dr. No's base) with the help of the generated force field from his golden eye. He is eventually sent to Crab Key, where he confronts Dr. No. During their duel, GoldenEye uses his mechanical eye to sabotage the island's nuclear reactor, causing it to electrocute Dr. No. Upon No's death, Goldfinger contacts GoldenEye and informs him that he believes he is too dangerous to be left alive, and that he had contacted GoldenEye earlier and told him to activate a program which would shut down the Lair's defense grid. Goldfinger reveals that he is intent on taking over the Lair, and leaves GoldenEye to die in the impending nuclear meltdown. GoldenEye, however, manages to escape in Dr. No's osprey before the reactor overloads and the island is destroyed in a large explosion.
GoldenEye returns to the Lair intent on confronting Goldfinger. Pussy Galore rendezvous with GoldenEye and informs him that Goldfinger has used the OMEN to wipe out most of the Lair's guards, and taken control of it. Scaramanga provides the mechanical eye with a computer virus that he can use to overload the OMEN.
GoldenEye fights his way through the Lair, implanting the computer virus in the process, eventually reaching the area where Goldfinger and the OMEN are. Goldfinger traps GoldenEye inside a chamber that he claims will soon be devoid of oxygen. The computer virus then activates the OMEN, causing it to explode in a burst of energy, killing Goldfinger and his troops. GoldenEye and Galore leave the Lair aboard Galore's chopper, and Scaramanga and Number One (Ernst Stavro Blofeld) later discuss what to do with GoldenEye and decide to simply see what he does next before proceeding.",2004-11-22 00:00:00.000,5,NULL,63.3333,4,43.6149,13

116543,25125,Great Battles of WWII: Stalingrad,"This game is based on real life historical events.
Year 1942. Stalingrad, Soviet Union. We are on one of the major battle on the Eastern Front of World War II in which Nazi Germany and its allies fight the Soviet Union for the control of the Stalingrad City  (now Volgograd) in Southern Russia, on the eastern boundary of Europe.

Marked by fierce close quarters combat and direct assaults on civilians by air raids, it is often regarded as one of the single largest (nearly 2.2 million personnel) and bloodiest (1.7–2 million wounded, killed or captured) battles in the history of warfare. The heavy losses inflicted on the German Wehrmacht make it arguably the most strategically decisive battle of the whole war.
It was a turning point in the European theatre of World War II; German forces never regained the initiative in the East and withdrew a vast military force from the West to replace their losses.

The German offensive to capture Stalingrad began in August 1942, using the German 6th Army and elements of the 4th Panzer Army. The attack was supported by intensive Luftwaffe bombing that reduced much of the city to rubble. The fighting degenerated into house-to-house fighting, and both sides poured reinforcements into the city. By mid-November 1942, the Germans had pushed the Soviet defenders back at great cost into narrow zones along the west bank of the Volga River.

On 19 November 1942, the Red Army launched Operation Uranus, a two-pronged attack targeting the weaker Romanian and Hungarian armies protecting the German 6th Army's flanks.
The Axis forces on the flanks were overrun and the 6th Army was cut off and surrounded in the Stalingrad area. Adolf Hitler ordered that the army stay in Stalingrad and make no attempt to break out; instead, attempts were made to supply the army by air and to break the encirclement from the outside. Heavy fighting continued for another two months. By early February 1943, the Axis forces in Stalingrad had exhausted their ammunition and food. The remaining units of the 6th Army surrendered. The battle lasted five months, one week, and three days.",2005-04-05 00:00:00.000,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,70.0000,3

191851,1530,Jak 3,"The game begins with Jak and Daxter being banished into the Wasteland by the tyrannical Count Veger for supposed crimes against Haven City. Ashelin, who opposes the banishment, gives Jak a beacon before she leaves and tells him to ""stay alive"". As they travel through the desert, flashbacks reveal that Haven City is at war between the Freedom League and the surviving Metal Heads and their allies, the KG Death Bots. The Palace is then destroyed by an unknown force. As Jak, Daxter, and Pecker lose consciousness, they are rescued by a group of desert-dwellers, who take them back to Spargus City.

Waking up in Spargus, the King, Damas, says that Jak must earn his place in the civilization by proving himself as a warrior in both the Arena challenges and by serving the city, who his ""life now belongs to"" for being rescued. His missions involve recovering artifacts after sandstorms, racing for both buggies and Leaper lizards for upgrades, Eco crystals and buggies, catching Kanga rats upon a Leaper lizard, and several other odd jobs in the oasis city. Most important among these events is that Jak is bestowed Light Eco abilities to balance the darkness within, granted to him at the Precursor temple by an oracle who believes that Jak is the last hope for the civilization. These powers include time-slowing abilities, healing powers, shield abilities, and even flight. Along the way, Jak befriends the Precursor Monk, Seem, and a buggy garage owner, Kliever – who initially dislike him until he gains their trust over time. During one of Damas' missions into the desert, Jak is found by Ashelin, who reveals that she knew Damas would find him since she knew he would check his old beacons. She refuses to tell him how she knows Damas and then begs Jak to come back to Haven City to defend it from the Metal Heads and the new Krimzon Guard Deathbots. Still embittered about being exiled, he refuses to return. Ashelin leaves him, but later, after finding out what the evil Count Veger has in store for his friends, Jak changes his mind and makes the journey via transport to Haven City. Jak and Daxter help reunite the resistance in Haven, who is divided due to barriers put up by enemies, and give them hope that they can beat back the Metal Heads and Deathbots.",2004-11-09 00:00:00.000,41,NULL,70.0000,3,75.5673,131

Combat racing became a sport over time in the dangerous Kras City. Jak, Daxter, Ashelin, Samos, Keira, Torn and Sig (Who does not attend) receive an invite to the reading of Krew's last will, as does his daughter, Rayn. After offering a toast, Krew reveals in a recording that everyone present has been poisoned with black shade. Krew gives an ultimatum: the only way to obtain the antidote is for everyone to race and win at the next Kras City Grand Championship.

As Jak and friends progress through each race, they find that another crime syndicate led by the mysterious Mizo has it in for Jak. Eventually it is revealed that Krew and Mizo made a deal before the events of Jak 3: both gangs were to make their own racing teams and the loser of the Kras City Championship will submit, making the winner the sole crime family in Jak's world.",2005-10-18 00:00:00.000,15,NULL,70.0000,2,76.5745,33

108507,43422,Killzone: Collector's Edition,"The game is set in an era of space colonization where the Helghan Empire has recovered from its defeat in the First Extrasolar War and launched a blitzkrieg against the outer ISA colony planet Vekta. Vekta's orbital Strategic Defense (SD) platforms failed during the initial assault, allowing the Helghast to land swarms of soldiers onto the surface. This makes it all the more difficult for the outnumbered ISA forces.

In the game, the Helghast are a faction of human descendants who colonized the planet Helghan many generations ago. The planet's harsh environment forced the Helghast to adapt and mutate so much that they can no longer be considered human. They are stronger, faster and more resilient than their cousins, and possess a burning hatred for humanity. Except for a small number of half-breed Helghast, the few social elite born commanders and some trained troopers, they all require a gas mask and air processing tank that creates air similar to the planet Helghan's atmosphere for long term period away from the planet. Unprepared, outnumbered and outgunned, Vekta's only hope rests with an elite squad of four soldiers who will turn the tide of the war.

As the climactic war razes across Vekta, Templar allies himself with troops on the outskirts of Vekta City, desperately repelling endless waves of besieging assaults from the imperious Helghast forces, but are eventually driven into a defensive retreat.",2004-11-02 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Keith wakes up on the beach of the south side of a deserted island. After exploring his surroundings, he finds shelter in a cave. The next day, Keith crosses a nearby river and finds Skye asleep next to her raft, which is apparently undamaged. After she wakes up, Keith and Skye meet for the first time and she tells him that she can't see very well because she has lost her glasses. Keith offers to help her look for her glasses, but accidentally steps on them during the search. With Skye's vision severely impaired, she becomes dependent on Keith to guide her safely around the island.

They successfully evade the Stiletto and make it back to the workshop, where Nat instructs the player use a new powered armor suit called the BattleArmor to stop the invaders. After this, hundreds of dropships enter Dante's atmosphere. Mysteriously, one of these dropships is shot down by the others. After fighting to the crash site, a strange new MechWarrior by the name of Alera emerges, a space pirate with a jumpship named the ""Jezebel"". Later, the MechWarrior escapes an enemy port, and steals an enemy tank from 3 soldiers in an attempt to infiltrate the enemy. An allied APC then comes out and follows the MechWarrior on his way. The tank must go through two scans to advance the level, but however, the ""Passenger Scan"" warns the enemies that it is a trick, and the MechWarrior and his allies must escape the port with a tank.

After several confrontations with the enemy, it is discovered that the aggressors seek to access the Lostech blueprints and prototypes stored in the data cores to create an unstoppable army of mechanised soldiers to obtain dominance over the Inner Sphere, starting with mass-producing the Ragnarok Prototype model that discovered in the first game.

A century later, in 1386, Zarok returns and casts a spell over Gallowmere, robbing the souls of its people and raising the dead. This spell also resurrects Dan, who is accompanied by Al-Zalam, a genie who was robbed of his powers by Zarok and cursed to reside in Dan's skull. Seeing his resurrection as a chance to prove himself a true hero, Dan goes on a quest to seek revenge against Zarok, collecting pieces of an artifact called the Anubis Stone along the way. After collecting all the pieces and making his way to Zarok's lair, Dan is confronted by Zarok and his immortal army, but Dan manages to stop this army by using the Anubis Stone to summon the souls of those who fought in the Battle of Gallowmere.

16286,1751,Mega Man X: Command Mission,"Prologue
In the year 22XX AD, a mysterious mineral known as Force Metal was extracted from the fragments of a meteor that landed in the Pacific Ocean. Technology based on the metal revolutionized the field of Reploid engineering. The Federation built Giga City, an artificial island, near the meteor site for the explicit purpose of mining and smelting Force Metal.

Everything seemed to go well, until a band of renegade Reploids armed themselves and launched a rebellion on the island. They banished all humans and demanded that the government recognize Giga City as an independent Reploid state. This new Rebellion Army and its leader, Epsilon, were all branded Mavericks for this deed.

After the first team of Maverick Hunters was annihilated or otherwise subdued by the Rebellion Army, Colonel Redips sent in a special team composed of X, Zero, and Shadow. If they failed their mission - arrest Epsilon and quell the Reploid insurrection - the Federation would have no choice but to declare all-out war on Giga City and the Rebellion Army.

Chapter 1: Infiltrate Giga City!
X, Zero, and Shadow teleport to the outskirts of Giga City to investigate an energy reading in the Lagrano Ruins. The trio are separated by a mysterious explosion, but they continue towards the top of the structure. X and Zero meet up near the top when they are suddenly attacked by Hippopressor, which they destroy.

Upon making it to the roof, X and Zero find Shadow faced with Epsilon. They begin to arrest Epsilon, but Shadow turns on them, revealing his true allegiance to the Rebellion Army. The Rebellion cadres - Scarface, Botos, and Ferham - also reveal themselves, and the Hunters realize that they've been led into an ambush. Zero attempts to strike Epsilon, but is overpowered and sent flying by the cadres attacks. Now alone, X finds himself with no other choice but to flee, leaping off the roof and into a chasm below. Ferham begins to give chase, but Epsilon stops her, well-aware that X will return.",2004-07-29 00:00:00.000,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,57.7602,9

To escape the carnage, humans have begun migrating to the Moon as part of an initiative known as the ""Jakob Project"", which involves an orbital elevator built in the Galapagos Islands. One night while X is out on patrol, one of the elevators breaks off and comes crashing down to Earth. As X approaches the elevator, the doors open, revealing an entire army of Sigmas. Suddenly, a purple-haired Reploid arrives and introduces himself as Lumine, the director of the Jakob Project. He reveals the ""Sigma army"" isn't what it appears to be; instead, they are new generation Reploids created as part of the project who are immune from viruses and able to use DNA copy data to change their shapes and appearances to assist with space development.",2004-12-07 00:00:00.000,7,NULL,NULL,NULL,73.5200,42

Zero and the Resistance join the chase, fighting off the Variants and saving the humans. Ciel and Zero meet the leader of the Caravan, Neige, who tells them about the current situation in Neo Arcadia, and that she is now leading her group to Area Zero, where a human settlement was established.

The Resistance convoy follows the Caravan into Area Zero. Exploring the habitat, Zero soon encounters the Einherjar Eight Warriors and their leader, Craft. Through them, Zero learns of Operation Ragnarok, a military operation where Weil plans to obliterate all inhabitable places like Area Zero so that humans would stop running away from Neo Arcadia. The Einherjar and Craft are the ones who will execute this plan, thinking the humans are foolish to even think of running away from Weil's rule.",2005-04-21 00:00:00.000,9,NULL,NULL,NULL,77.9986,34
178322,24275,Mega Man: Maverick Hunter X,"Unlike Mega Man Powered Up, Maverick Hunter X is a reboot to the X series that has many changes to the story that completely disconnect it to the original timeline. It was the intention of Keiji Inafune to completely redo the first six games of the Mega Man X series, but this project was discontinued due to poor sales of Maverick Hunter X.

These are some examples of the continuity with the rest of the series being ignored:

Dr. Cain discovered X many years ago (as opposed to months), and is artificially extending his life via mechanical support to oversee the Reploids. He also fears he does not have long to live. Towards the end of The Day of Sigma, a missile also destroys his home in Abel City - with him inside it (although it is left ambiguous as to whether Cain had actually died or not).

Vile's story, barring his flashback to Sigma's release of him from his cell, is merely considered a ""what-if"" scenario, as it conflicts with X's game. However, the line by Sigma to ""retrieve Vile"" seems to foreshadow his remodel in Mega Man X3.

Dr. Light's reasons for sealing X are completely different from the version previously established. In the original storyline, Dr. Light sealed X in a special capsule that would basically test his moral integrity, because it would be necessary to determine whether X would ultimately make the right decisions when he entered the world. However, in Maverick Hunter X, Dr. Light is already confident with X's moral integrity, but seals him up because he believes mankind is not ready for him just yet.

Sigma's personality is depicted quite differently than in other games. Here, he is obsessed with the evolution of Reploids (which somewhat reflects his attitude in Mega Man X8), and is fascinated with X's potential rather than truly wishing to overcome the humans. He even directly states to Vile he plans to go Maverick to test X's abilities and bring out his true power, and instructs Vile to help him incite rebellion to help achieve this. As such, he also seemed to have gone Maverick of his own free will, although his statement when releasing Vile that he ""needed someone who could go Maverick of [his] own accord"" in the opening to Vile Mode implies that this might not necessarily be the case.

On a similar note, his interactions with X before the final battle are slightly different from the original, where he had been expecting Zero to arrive and was slightly annoyed that he was about to face X instead before ultimately realizing upon Velguarder's defeat that Zero may have chosen X to fight Sigma for a reason, while in the remake he was shown to be genuinely expecting X to arrive and hoping he did in fact meet the qualifications to face him.",2005-12-15 00:00:00.000,3,NULL,85.0000,1,77.3017,23

The employees and the memories they shared might have survived, but without a building there can be no cafe; Hitoshi and co. are left with no choice but to abandon Famille.

But as luck - or perhaps fate - would have it, Hitoshi gets a second chance when he receives a phone call from a new mall asking him to open a branch of Famille inside their building. Hitoshi can't refuse the offer to carry on his brother's will, and after a few twists and turns a new Famille is born with Hitoshi as the manager.

Of course, life never quite goes that smoothly. Things are a mess both in the kitchen and on the floor because two key staff members refused to return. Hitoshi himself had to take a break from college in order to make opening the new cafe a reality. But perhaps the biggest problem of all is staring Famille right in the face - Curio, the popular cafe that Famille was ""inspired"" by in the first place, happened to open a branch in the same shopping center directly across from Famille...

And thus the new Famille's battle for survival begins.",2005-02-25 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

158346,8074,Pathologic,"The game is about three characters who are mostly known by their nicknames: two men, Bachelor (Бакалавр) and Haruspex (Гаруспик), and a girl nicknamed Devotress (Самозванка). Each of them tries to uncover the source of a strange lethal sickness known as the ""sand plague"" that has befallen a small town. Although players can play as each of them, there is only one storyline, which is seen from different points of view depending upon the chosen character. The ability to uncover some secrets depend on which character is being played and the characters also interact with the other two unchosen characters and discuss their progress over the course of the game.

The game takes place in a perpetual world over a time frame of 12 in-game days. Throughout each day, the player receives quests from NPCs, however, the game continues regardless of whether they are completed or not. At exactly midnight of each day, the incomplete quests are erased from the player's notebook. Quests are divided into main missions, (one per day) which decide if a major character will die, and side quests, which earn money and items. Completing main quests is essential to discovering the secrets of the town, as characters can die off early in the game who would otherwise reveal information later in the game.

While trying to discover the secrets of the town, the player's other goal is simply to survive to the end of the 12 days by balancing various resources within the game's fluctuating economy, which represents the harsh ""supply and demand"" nature of a shut-off disease ridden town.

On the edge of town, there is a great building named Polyhedron (Многогранник), a geometrically impossible structure used as a fortress by children. On the opposite side lies an ominous mountain called the Abattoir, with the Apiary, an insane asylum, next to it. All districts and major buildings of the town are named after body parts and biology.",2005-06-09 00:00:00.000,4,NULL,60.0000,1,80.7647,21

181869,8747,Perfect World,"In the beginning of time, the first God of the universe, Pan Gu, lived an immortal life. But with no subjects to lord over, Pan Gu grew tired of his solitary existence and decided to decompose his body into five elements-fire, metal, wood, earth, and water. With his divine power, Pan Gu forged these elements into air, land, mountains, rivers, seas, and plant life and laid the foundation for a new world. It was then that Pan Gu made his first attempt to fill this new world with life. From his shadow he formed the first sentient beings. These unnamed creatures were uncivilized, and before long, they began turning on one another and corrupting the world around them. Pan Gu saw that what he had created had become an Imperfect World, and moved quickly to rectify his mistake. He built a floating city known as Heaven's Tear, and placed within the city the few creatures that had yet to be corrupted. Then, with the power of water and wind, Pan Gu created a massive flood, which swept through the land and destroyed all life in its path.
The world now cleansed, Pan Gu set about creating a new world, one filled with beings who were capable of Spiritual Cultivation. He created three races that possessed the traits he most treasured in himself. The Human race was born of Pan Gu's spirit, and demonstrated morality, honor, and an unlimited imagination. The race of the Untamed, born of Pan Gu's body, embodied freedom and peace, and possessed a unique connection with the natural order of the world. And the third race, the Winged Elves, were born of Pan Gu's own blood, and exemplified beauty, grace, and purity. Between the three races, the Perfect World was created.
The chief quality that Pan Gu gave all three races was free will. He vowed never again to eradicate an entire species, so all conflicts between the races were to be resolved amongst themselves. One such conflict arose between the Humans and Winged Elves when the two races discovered the city of Heaven's Tear. A war erupted as they fought for control of the great city, bringing out the worst in both races. The Untamed remained neutral, as they were content with living in harmony with the natural world. As the war intensified, and neither side relented, a new threat emerged.
The race that was thought to have been eradicated in the great flood returned in full force. These creatures were not quite living, but not quite dead, and thus came to be known as wraiths. The wraiths appeared to possess a singular objective: to destroy the other races and corrupt the beautiful world around them. Rumors swirled that the wraiths were capable of possessing other living things. Not much is known about the true nature of this evil, but one thing is clear. The three races Human, Untamed, and Winged Elf must set aside their differences and unite to preserve their way of life, halt the spread of corruption, and above all, protect the Perfect World.",2005-07-01 00:00:00.000,6,NULL,NULL,NULL,60.5477,27

The Psychosphere acted as a conduit, providing means to reach another, untouched world, a new Promised Land, by jumping between flat worlds within the Psychosphere. The Psychosphere is appropriately named, as the various worlds resemble the thoughts and actions that have occurred upon Earth during its history. The Spirits then embarked upon the construction of massive floating city-ships called Frames, which could house hundreds of thousands of people for an indefinite period of time.

177877,1426,Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney,"The first case of the game presents defense attorney Phoenix Wright at his first trial under Mia Fey's watchful eye, successfully defending his childhood friend Larry Butz for murder. However, in the game's second case, Mia is murdered for being aware of corporate blackmail, and her younger sister Maya Fey is charged with the crime because her name was found on a piece of evidence. While defending her, Phoenix is reintroduced to another childhood friend, Miles Edgeworth, who is the prosecutor for Maya's case and has established himself as a ""genius"" for the prosecution system. Maya is found not guilty of the crime, and becomes Phoenix's assistant in further cases, offering her channeling ability as a ""Spirit Medium"" of Kurain village to bring the spirit of Mia to help at critical times. Phoenix and Edgeworth find that while they have their friendship from their youth, they continue to face off against each other in the courtroom. In the third case, Phoenix and Maya investigate the murder of a famous actor.In the fourth case, Edgeworth is charged with murder, and Phoenix steps up to defend him. It is discovered that Edgeworth was set up by his old mentor, Manfred von Karma. Several years earlier, Manfred shot and killed Edgeworth's father, a defense attorney, after he ruined Manfred's perfect record, but led Edgeworth to believe he shot his own father. Phoenix is able to expose Manfred's cover-up and achieve a ""not guilty"" verdict for Edgeworth. After the case, Edgeworth thinks about taking time off from his position to consider the events, while Maya announces she is going back to her home in Kurain Village to train.
The fifth case, added for the Nintendo DS, iOS, and Wii versions, has Ema Skye begging Wright for help to defend her older sister Lana, who is on trial for murder, compounded by a second murder of the same apparent victim in a different building at the same time. Using Ema's scientific help to establish evidence and the surprising prosecution help of Edgeworth during the trial, Phoenix is able to learn that Lana Skye was blackmailed by the Chief of Police Damon Gant into covering for a murder she thought that Ema had committed several years before. Gant himself is revealed to have committed the murder and pinned the blame on Ema. Though Lana is cleared of murder charges, she willingly goes to jail for being an accomplice; Ema says her goodbyes as she heads to Europe to study forensic science.",2005-09-15 00:00:00.000,81,NULL,80.0000,3,82.9064,251

And as he enters he is greeted by Hoshino Yumemi, a companion robot.
Without a single shred of doubt, she assumes he is the first customer she's had in 30 years.
She attempts to show him the stars at once, but the planetarium projector is broken.

The Prince seeks counsel from an old wise man who explains that whoever releases The Sands of Time must die. Because the Prince escaped his fate, it is the Dahaka's mission as guardian of the Timeline to ensure that he dies as he was meant to. The old man also tells of the Island of Time, where the Empress of Time first created the Sands. The Prince sets sail for the Island in an attempt to prevent the Sands from ever being created, an act he believes will appease the Dahaka. After a battle at sea with an enemy force led by a mysterious woman in black capsizes the Prince's ship, the Prince washes ashore unconsciously onto the Island of Time.
He later awakens and chases the woman in black through the Empress of Time's fortress into a portal that transports the two into the past. The Prince saves a woman named Kaileena from being killed by the woman in black, whose name is Shahdee. Unable to grant the Prince an audience with the Empress of Time, who is busy preparing to create the Sands, Kaileena instead tells him how to unlock the door to the throne room in which the Empress resides. The Prince makes his way through the fortress, utilizing the sand portals to travel back and forth between the past and present, and narrowly escapes several encounters with the Dahaka, who he discovers cannot pass through water. The Prince activates the mechanisms in the two towers of the fortress - the Garden Tower and the Mechanical Tower - that serve as locks to the door. He returns to the throne room only to discover that Kaileena is actually the Empress of Time herself, who has foreseen in the Timeline that the Prince will kill her and who has decided to attempt to defy her fate, just as the Prince is doing. A battle ensues and the Prince proves victorious; he kills Kaileena and returns to the present. What lies ahead is the most dramatic Twist in the Prince's life, and He starts believing the priest who told him ""You cant change your Fate! No Man Can.."" But Prince is not going to give up that easily.",2004-11-30 00:00:00.000,147,NULL,79.6000,7,83.0244,389

25540,8320,Psychotoxic,"NEW YORK 2022 - An international crisis shakes the world order. Cities crumble, wars rage on all continents. The USA is in a state of emergency. Public order can only be maintained with the help of the military. Amidst this madness there is Angie Prophet. Angie is a very attractive young woman who was raised an orphan by her Aunt Julie in Brooklyn New York. A few years ago she moved to Washington to live her own life. Her employment at the Devil's Inn, a name that commands considerable respect toughened her up.  
 
Shortly before Christmas the doorbell rang and she was dragged into a wild, unexpected adventure that would change her life forever. Although Angie could certainly imagine more pleasant things, it is her task to prevent the bombing of New York with thermonuclear weapons. In order to prevent this she must battle the Fourth Horseman of the Apocalypse, a mystical machine from Ancient Babylon. The Fourth Horseman is located in a series of caves beneath New York City, where he is constantly producing microscopic nanobots. These nanobots spread rapidly around the world and are programmed to increase the potential for human violence by manipulating certain parts of the brain. Angie's worldly opponent is the satanic Aaron Crowley, the man who activated the Fourth Horseman. His influence extends all the way to the top of the US government and he does not hesitate to use this power against Angie in order to prevent the Horseman from being destroyed. In the course of the game, Angie will discover why she is the only one who can stop the Fourth Horseman and why she possesses peculiar powers that will be essential to complete her task. In order to overpower the superior numbers of her enemy Angie finds a virtual sidekick Max on her side. Angie must fight her way through 19 levels in the real world and through 10 dream levels with different themes before she reaches her biggest challenge: the final battle with the Fourth Horseman and Aaron Crowley. On the way to her destination Angie must face zombies, cyborgs with flamethrowers, insane policemen and FBI-agents, deep sea monsters and psycho killers to name but a few.  All in all she will meet more than 90 different enemies and she will have 19 weapons to fight them with.",2005-02-28 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

The actual tournament follows over five days in which cut sequences telling the character's story are interspersed with matches. These are elimination-based, but there's the option to instantly replay a match that has been lost. The second day always features a mud match, and the fourth is usually a match of special significance, involving a shocking revelation or an encounter with a rival. The climax comes in a final boss fight against the mysterious Lady X and the resolution of the character's story. 
 
Defeating Lady X unlocks a new alternate story mode, featuring the characters alter-ego. It may be supposed that this takes place some time later after the character has 'turned'. In this mode, there are cut sequences only at the start and finish of the character's story. In between she fights a number of matches against various opponents (including one mud wrestling). The final match begins with a cut sequence, and is usually against a special rival (though in a few cases its Lady X again) and winning this match completes the story.

176932,23866,School Days,"It was at the beginning of second semester that Makoto first caught sight of the beautiful Kotonoha reading on the train to school. Ever since, watching her read has been the one source of delight in his otherwise uneventful mornings.

It wasn't that he wanted to go out with her, or even to be noticed by her.
Just watching her from afar made his days a little bit brighter - and it's certainly not as if he believed in that charm that everyone was talking about...

One day, Makoto's classmate Sekai catches sight of Kotonoha's picture on his phone and discovers his secret affection for her. To Makoto's surprise, Sekai gives him her full and enthusiastic support. Her encouragment brings fresh color to his dull, uneventful life.

From the moment she drags the two of them to their first lunch together, the barriers between Makoto and Kotonoha begin to fall. Sekai, however, grows increasingly distracted, as if lost in her own thoughts.
On the platform at dusk, Makoto waits for Kotonoha to arrive for their first date.
Sekai passes by on the way home from school.

Grateful for her part in bringing him and Kotonoha together, Makoto promises to do anything he can to thank her.

A moment later, Makoto stands there on the platform, stunned.

On the train, Sekai clasps her phone, a picture of Makoto set within.

Kotonoha hurries towards the station, a cheerful smile on her face.

And so, as three hearts burn with three different emotions, the story begins.",2005-04-28 00:00:00.000,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,75.5957,7

56415,14586,Seal of Evil,"The Seal of Evil story is set in the twilight years of the Warring States period of Chinese history (476 ? 206 BC). This turbulent time marks the disintegration of the longest lived of all imperial dynasties, the Zhou. Out of the strife and chaos emerges a nobleman possessed of an indomitable spirit and an uncompromising vision of the future: Ying Zheng, ruler of the Qin state.

89416,4172,Shadow Hearts: From the New World,"The game begins in North America in the year 1929 and features two new main characters: a 16-year-old New Yorker named Johnny Garland, and a 21-year-old Native American woman named Shania, who has powers of fusion similar to Yuri and Kurando in the previous Shadow Hearts entries, although she is not a harmonixer. She makes pacts with spirits while Yuri and Kurando turned into demons. The story begins with Johnny, a private detective, being hired by a man named Gilbert to find one Marlow Brown. When Johnny finds the man, however, a mysterious 'window' opens, and from it emerges a monster. The rest of the game follows Johnny, Shania, and company as they attempt to uncover the truth about Gilbert and his plans.

Meanwhile in Brooklyn, a wanted criminal who was severely injured was being pursued by the police. He met a mysterious woman who rescued him by finishing off his pursuers with ease. Then, she healed his wounds with the 'Kiss of Malice.' Nobody knows what her intentions or motives are, nor did she speak a single word. The man who identified himself as 'Killer', called her 'Lady' and thereafter followed her where ever she would go.

Shania later teams up with Johnny, accompanied by her guardian, Natan to investigate the strange happening Johnny has witnessed. Arriving at Arkham University, they meet Gilbert, who reveals his true intentions to open the Gate and rain Malice upon the world. Gilbert later teams up with Lady and Killer to achieve his goal. Johnny continues his pursuit to stop Gilbert and meets new allies along the way. They include: Frank; a wacky ninja, Ricardo; a lone guitarist, Master Mao; a cat specialized in the Drunken Fist and Hildegard Valentine; sister of the vampire brothers Joachim and Keith Valentine in the Shadow Hearts series.

Together, Johnny and his friends travel across the globe to stop the evil plans of Gilbert, Lady and Killer. Johnny finds out a shocking truth along the way - that he was revived using the Emigre Manuscript and that Lady was actually his sister, Grace Garland. Their father had revived them after losing them in an accident. He was eventually killed by Grace as she had transferred all her Will into Johnny in exchange for his Malice. This explains why Lady does not speak; she has no memories and is only acting instinctively on the Malice in her body.

An epic battle with Killer eventually defeated unlocks Johnny's ""Awaker"" powers and Lady calls out Killer's name for the first time. The ritual to invoke the opening of the Gate of Malice is going underway and Johnny is determined to stop his sister. The team battles Gilbert, powered by Malice, for one last time before the final confrontation with Lady. Lady is finally put to rest with Johnny delivering the final blow and she disappears along with Killer's body.

Months later, Johnny receives a case from his detective agency and he proceeds to investigate. There are two different endings, the Good Ending and the Bad Ending. In the Good Ending, Shania follows Johnny out of the agency. In the Bad Ending, Shania watches over from a building with red eyes; an evidence that she has been consumed by Malice. The Good Ending can be obtained by maxing out all of Shania's fetishes including the ones for the optional fusion.",2005-07-28 00:00:00.000,4,NULL,75.0000,3,40.3113,6

104572,2207,Shadow of the Colossus,"The story of Shadow of the Colossus begins as Wander enters the forbidden land, traveling across the long bridge at its entrance on his horse, Agro. According to Lord Emon later in the game, prior to entering the forbidden land Wander had stolen an ancient sword, which is the only weapon capable of slaying the colossi of the forbidden land. Led to the massive Shrine of Worship at the center of the region, Wander carries with him the body of a maiden named Mono. A moment later, several shadow-like creatures with humanoid forms appear and prepare to attack Wander, but he easily dismisses them with a wave of the ancient sword in his possession, which emits strong beams of light. After vanquishing the shadow creatures, the voice of the disembodied entity known as ""Dormin"" echoes from above, expressing surprise that Wander possesses the weapon. Wander requests that Dormin return Mono's soul to her body, which it states may be possible, but only if the sixteen idols lining the temple's hall are destroyed. It explains that this task can only be accomplished by using the ancient sword to kill sixteen colossi located throughout the land. Each contains a portion of Dormin's own essence, though this is not revealed until late in the game.

Despite a warning from Dormin that he may have to pay a great price to revive Mono, Wander sets out to search the land for the colossi and destroy them. In a sequence after the eighth's slaying, a deterioration of Wander's body is shown clearly—his skin becoming paler, his hair darker, and dark streaks growing across his face. After the death of the twelfth colossus, it is revealed to the player that Wander is being pursued by a group of warriors led by Emon.

Urged to hurry with his task by Dormin, Wander soon heads off to defeat the sixteenth and final colossus. On the way to this confrontation, he travels on horseback across a long bridge, which begins to collapse as he is halfway across. As Agro jumps over the last gap in the bridge, the portion which is landed on begins to separate from its foundation, causing Agro to nearly lose footing. Sensing the impending fall, Agro jerks forward to throw Wander to safety on the other side, making a sacrifice for him and falling into the river hundreds of feet below as the bridge finally gives way. Wander goes on to defeat the final colossus, and Emon's company arrives in the Shrine of Worship just as the last temple idol crumbles; Wander appears soon afterwards, his eyes and skin now both entirely pale, and two small horns protruding from his head. Declaring that Wander has been ""possessed by the dead"", Lord Emon orders his warriors to kill him. While he struggles to reach Mono, one warrior shoots Wander in the leg with a crossbow, while another stabs him through his heart with a sword. Black blood sprays from the wound as Wander's body becomes covered in darkness and falls to the floor—a death identical to those suffered by the colossi.

Afterward, Dormin's spirit possesses Wander's body, transforming it into a shadowy giant. Dormin, now speaking in its masculine voice, explains that it had been separated to sixteen pieces—the colossi—to seal away its power, and that by entering Wander, who absorbed physical form from defeating each colossus, it is now whole again. While his men flee, Lord Emon casts the ancient sword into a small pool at the back of the temple's hall, creating a whirlwind of light that consumes Dormin and Wander. Emon and his men flee the forbidden land as the bridge connecting to the temple collapses behind them. As they safely arrive at the entrance to the forbidden land, Emon expresses hope that if Wander survived, someday he may be able to atone for his crimes.

In the temple, Mono awakens, restored by Dormin in accordance with its agreement with Wander, and Agro limps into the temple with an injured hind leg. Mono follows Agro to the pool into which Wander and Dormin were pulled by Emon's spell, finding a male infant with tiny horns on his head. She takes the child with her, following the horse to higher levels of the Shrine of Worship, and arrives at a secret garden within the shrine as the game ends.",2005-10-18 00:00:00.000,368,1,88.5000,4,90.1701,904
181383,43387,Shadow Of The Colossus: Limited Edition,"One cloudy night, a lone hawk flies by two longtime companions - Wander and his horse Agro - navigating an unforgiving cliffside path on the edge of a canyon. The two have been traveling for a long time on this offbeat path, through murky forests and wet grasslands alike.

They arrive at last at their destination: a tall stone gate with a narrow passage. On the other side lies an enormous bridge of near-otherworldly construction. The bridge spans over the Forbidden Lands, a dramatic landscape of plains and canyons with enclosed and cut-off environments ranging from arid deserts to clefts with tall geysers to dark forests and murky crevasses.

The bridge finally comes to an end at the Shrine of Worship, a gigantic structure in the middle of the Lands. Wander and Agro make their way to the ground floor and the temple's main hall, which is lined with sixteen stone idols. At the end of the empty hall is an altar. Here it is shown that Wander is carrying something with him: a body wrapped in a cloth sheet. He places the body on the altar and removes the sheet, revealing Mono, a young woman clothed in a white dress.

The game suddenly cuts to a picture of an owl mask amidst a cloudy sky. From here, Lord Emon, a spiritual leader in Wander's society, speaks an esoteric monologue:

That place...began from the resonance of intersecting points...
They are memories replaced by ens and naught and etched into stone.
Blood, young sprouts, sky - and the one with the ability to control beings created from light...
In that world, it is said that if one should wish it, one can bring back the souls of the dead.
But to trespass upon that land is strictly forbidden...

Agro is suddenly frightened by a noise from behind the trio. Several shadowy apparitions are emerging from the temple floor, and Wander sees this and draws a mysterious sword from its sheath, pointing it towards the shadows. The blade emits an otherworldly energy, and the creatures immediately dissolve into thin air. Immediately, a booming pair of voices fill the halls from a great aperture above, surprised that Wander possesses the ""Ancient Sword"". Wander correctly identifies the voices as belonging to Dormin and asks that Mono be revived. Initially, Dormin expresses an indifference towards the matter, but ultimately cannot hide the interest in the sword Wander carries.",2005-11-18 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

At the end of the conflict, those who survived were gathered as one within the Cathedral, and after many decades, what was once known as Tokyo came to be reinvented as ""Tokyo Millennium"".

55176,22562,Shining Force Neo,"Thirteen years before the game begins, the world was locked in a war against the Clan of the Moon. Foul monsters known as ""Legions"" were unleashed by the Clan against their enemies in their bid for domination. However, powerful heroes called Forces soon rose up to lead the charge against them. Aided by Force Frames, ordinary warriors became gifted with a variety of powerful advantages that made them more than what they would have been otherwise. With this, the war against the Clan of the Moon began to turn. The Clan's Dark Castle and the Legions were banished in the end. Victory was achieved, but only at a great cost. Several nations were utterly destroyed and most of the Forces that participated in the final battle had perished.

When the story starts, a young warrior named Max has nearly completed the training that will make him a Force. Journeying home, he hopes to achieve his dream, not realizing that it is only the beginning of an adventure that will take him and his friends across the world to stop the return of evil.",2005-03-24 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,40.0000,1,NULL,NULL

Inspector Carmelita Montoya Fox and her new partner, Constable Neyla, confront Sly, but he escapes before Carmelita and Neyla can arrest him. Before making his escape, Sly hears Neyla suggest that the evidence actually suggests that the Klaww Gang stole the parts for their own use.

The Cooper Gang heads to Paris, where the first Klaww Gang member Dimitri is using Clockwerk tail feathers as printing plates to create counterfeit money. Sly and the gang shut the operation down and Dimitri is arrested by Interpol. The gang then heads to India, where the second Klaww Gang member Rajan puts Clockwerk's wings on display at a ball he is hosting. Rajan is also the kingpin of a local crime syndicate that grows and sells ""spice"", an illegal plant indigenous to the Indian jungle. Also present at the ball are the other Klaww Gang members and several undercover Interpol agents, including Carmelita and Neyla. The gang steals the Clockwerk wings in the middle of the ballroom while a disguised Sly creates a distraction by dancing with Carmelita. After the Cooper gang escapes with the Clockwerk wings, Carmelita blows her cover and starts making arrests. The Klaww Gang flees the scene, and Rajan goes into hiding somewhere deep in the jungle. The gang tracks him to his spice-growing facility in a long-abandoned temple, where he is using half of Clockwerk heart to super-irrigate his spice crops. He carries the other half of the heart on the end of a staff that he carries with him at all times. The gang steals both halves of the heart and incapacitates Rajan, but Carmelita, Neyla and the Contessa arrive. Neyla frames Carmelita of working with the Cooper Gang on the night the Clockwerk wings were stolen. She betrays the Cooper Gang and puts Sly, Murray, and Carmelita under arrest.",2004-09-14 00:00:00.000,37,NULL,80.0000,4,84.5025,108
75563,1800,Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves,"Set a year after the events of Band of Thieves, Sly Cooper, Bentley, Murray, and other unidentified characters attempt to open the Cooper Vault on Kaine Island. Unfortunately, they are intercepted by Dr. M, the owner of the island. Murray and Bentley escape, but a monster grabs Sly. During this scene, Sly's life flashes before his eyes, and the game flashes back.

Sly learned that the Cooper Vault was hidden on Kaine Island from one of his father's colleagues, Jim McSweeney. The vault contains the accumulated wealth of the Cooper Clan built up over the centuries. Sly went to find the vault, only to discover that M had built a fortress on the island in an attempt to get at the wealth hidden in the vault. Sly needed additional experts in order to get past Dr. M's extensive security; he needed the Cooper Gang back in action.

First, Sly and Bentley seek Murray, who had left the team due to guilt for causing Bentley's leg injury, which would end up paralyzing him. They learn about a mob boss, Octavio, who operates in Venice, Italy, where Murray was. Sly finds Dimitri in a cell at the local police station. He agrees to find Murray if Sly helps him escape. Sly finds Murray, while evading Carmelita Fox, who had become more hateful towards crimes since their last encounter. Murray had become a trainee for a peace-loving figure known as the Guru in order to become more peaceful. Murray refuses to rejoin Sly and Bentley until the canals are clean, the task the Guru gave to him. Sly and Bentley take down Octavio, who had been polluting the canals with tar as part of a scheme to threaten the city into liking opera again. After putting together some plans, they destroy Octavio's comeback recital, but Octavio injures Bentley, making Murray so mad that he quits his training and battles Octavio and defeats him.

162974,6599,Sonic Advance 3,"Prior to the game's events, Doctor Eggman builds a robotic assistant named Gemerl, using parts from the robot Emerl who was destroyed in Sonic Battle. Eggman attempts an experiment using the Chaos Emeralds to perform the Chaos Control technique, but it goes awry and tears the world apart. This action separates Sonic and Tails from Amy, Knuckles, and Cream, all of whom Eggman finds and captures, intending to create a segment of his impending empire on each chunk of the planet. Sonic and Tails travel through the game's seven levels to recapture their friends and retrieve the Emeralds.

The final boss fight takes place at the Altar Emerald temple. If the player defeats Eggman there without having all seven Chaos Emeralds, Eggman and Gemerl escape and fall off the edge of the temple. Peace is restored to the world, and Omochao snaps a picture of the five heroes. However, the game alerts the player that the Emeralds must still be collected for the true ending. If the player defeats Eggman at the temple with all the Chaos Emeralds, Gemerl stops running away with Eggman and attacks Sonic, causing the Emeralds to scatter. Gemerl uses them to take on a giant, orb-shaped form, but Sonic also uses their power to attain his Super Sonic form. With Eggman's help, Super Sonic destroys Gemerl. Tails later finds Gemerl's broken body on a beach, repairing and reprogramming it. The game ends as Cream plays with the now non-aggressive Gemerl at her mother Vanilla's house.",2004-06-07 00:00:00.000,8,NULL,72.0000,2,71.4087,46

Her world had the seven Sol Emeralds—gems similar to the Chaos Emeralds—which it relies on for survival. However, they were stolen by Dr. Eggman and as Blaze was chasing him, a light brought her to this world. Blaze then makes it her goal to personally retrieve the Emeralds from Eggman. Upon finding Eggman, the doctor flaunts a Sol Emerald, stating that he needs them to access ultimate power. Enraged, Blaze defeats Eggman and regains the Emerald. Though Eggman escapes, Blaze is determined to get the rest.

Confused and alone, Blaze ponders how she will get the Sol Emeralds back, and how to return home. She soon spots Cream the Rabbit and Cheese hiding in the bushes, and is surprised by Cream's politeness, the young rabbit eager to make friends with Blaze. Brought to Cream's home for a cup of tea, Vanilla and Cream convince Blaze to have the latter be her local guide after hearing her story. However, Blaze dismisses their advice to seek Sonic's aid, believing she can do this alone. Despite having Cream tag along, Blaze remains mostly indifferent to the young rabbit's efforts to be her friend.

Elsewhere, Sonic encounters Eggman during a run, who boasts about how he will soon have ultimate power. Upon defeating Eggman, Sonic finds a Sol Emerald that Eggman dropped, at which point Blaze appears and reclaims it, thanking Sonic for defeating Eggman before leaving. Confused, Sonic teams up with Tails to figure out what is going on while collecting the Chaos Emeralds.",2005-11-15 00:00:00.000,8,NULL,75.0000,2,72.7550,56

There, team leader Delta-38 (""Boss"", the player character) meets up with squad mates 62, 40, and 07 (""Scorch"", ""Fixer"" and ""Sev"" respectively) as they are given their first assignment: to assassinate Sun Fac, chief lieutenant of Geonosian Archduke Poggle the Lesser, one of the members of the Separatist Council. Upon successful completion of their objective, Delta Squad sabotage the droid factory underneath Sun Fac's headquarters, disable an anti-aircraft bunker that is wreaking havoc on the Republic Army's air forces, and sneak onto a disabled Separatist Trade Federation Lucrehulk-class Core Ship to steal important launch codes to prevent the Separatist fleet from retreating; escaping moments before the ship is destroyed.

A year into the war, the now-veteran Delta Squad is sent to investigate the derelict Acclamator-class Republic Assault Ship (RAS) Prosecutor, their former home before being deployed to active duty. Delta Squad splits up to investigate, quickly losing contact with command as they board the ship. Making their way inside, the squad find the Prosecutor seemingly abandoned and in disrepair. The squad lose contact with Scorch after he reports electrical interference with his visor and Boss is soon ambushed by scavenger droids. Boss makes his way to one of the ship's data cores to reunite with Sev, but he is suddenly attacked and captured by a Trandoshan who is part of a large crew of slavers and mercenaries who’ve taken over the ship. Having evaded capture, Boss and Fixer meet up but are soon attacked by battle droids deployed by the Trandoshans. After rescuing their captive squad members, Delta Squad takes back the ship’s bridge and destroy a jamming device which reestablishes communication with command. It becomes clear that the Trandoshans intend to sell the vessel to the Separatists in exchange for battle droid dispensers. Making their way down to the hangars, Delta Squad then destroys the Trandoshan dropship during their retreat. Immediately afterwards, a Lucrehulk-class Trade Federation Battleship drops out of hyperspace. As Republic reinforcements are en route, Delta Squad defends the vessel against hordes of battle droids. After successfully repelling the incoming droid forces, the enemy Battleship begins opening fire on the Prosecutor. Delta Squad fight their way to the gunnery deck to activate the ship's turbo lasers in order to defend themselves. The timely arrival of a second Republic ship, the RAS Arrestor, buys the squad enough time to activate the turbo lasers, ultimately destroying the Separatist Battleship and shutting down all remaining battle droids on board.",2005-02-17 00:00:00.000,50,NULL,80.8000,6,81.9615,168

Against this creeping apocalypse, several groups have developed responses. The Aeque Church, led by High Priestess Lumena, believes that the Miasma is God's will, sent to bring the world to an end, not with a bang, but a whimper.

83171,124605,Stinkoman 20X6,"Stinkoman wins a challenge against a robot named Tampo, which makes him want to go home. On his journey home, he fights Tampo's brain. Upon arrival at his house, he gets a bowl of chicken soup with a dumpling. 1-Up informs Stinkoman that Pan Pan has been kidnapped, and Stinkoman chokes on a chicken bone. He is determined to challenge the chicken whose bone he choked on. After beating the chicken, Brody, he goes outside and encounters a short wall. He jumps into space to get over the wall, which turns out to be another robot, Stlunko. After beating the robot, Stinkoman takes its stone fist and uses it as his powerup. 1-Up goes out to rescue Pan Pan, and takes Stinkoman's Power Crunch (a cassette tape) through the Lava Zone. To save his favorite Power Crunch, Stinkoman must protect 1-Up from above. His powerup fist breaks while he fights a lava snake named Saargtsson, to Stinkoman's dismay. 
 
1-Up still wants to save Pan Pan, and Stinkoman isn't willing to help, so 1-Up goes to the moon on his own, where he gets kidnapped by a shadowy figure— the same one that kidnapped Pan Pan. Meanwhile, Stinkoman takes a vacation to the Pink Cloud Zone for recreational challenges. The shadowy figure presses a red button to teleport Stinkoman to an icy place, then inside a wall. He blasts a section out of the wall and escapes to the Negative Zone, a glitchy level. There, he finds out that 1-Up and Pan Pan are at level 10, where the red button is. This leads Stinkoman to believe that they red buttoned him, so he goes to level 10 to get revenge. An evil jungle separates him from level 10 (an evil fortress), so he uses his ship, the Stinkowing, to fly through. The shadowy figure tries to stop him by sending a fleet of robotic sea creatures. Eventually, Stinkoman finally makes it to the evil fortress.",2005-03-21 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

180315,24955,Tears to Tiara,"The game draws heavily from Welsh, Celt, Christian and Roman mythology, with characters named Arawn, Arthur, Epona, Llŷr, Morgan, Pwyll, Rhiannon, and Taliesin. Set in a Late Antiquity-inspired fantasy setting, story starts on an island Erin (or Hibernia, as shown on an in-game map) on the west border of the Holy Empire.

Prologue is centered around the precognition-gifted priestess of the Gael tribe, Rhiannon. She is kidnapped by a rogue priest of the Holy Empire, Drwc, to be used as a sacrifice in a ritual meant to resurrect the Demon King Arawn and put Drwc in his favor. As a response the Gael people burn their village and swear to bring Rhiannon back or exact revenge on the Empire. In the middle of the ritual, as the Gael people attack Drwc's soldiers, Arawn is resurrected and offered Rhiannon. At this point, he kills Drwc, frees Rhiannon, and proclaims no intention in wreaking havoc which the legends attributed to him. Instead, he shows interest in Rhinannon's brother Arthur, the First Warrior of his tribe. Rhiannon, on the other hand, falls in love with Arawn, and by declaring her decision to marry him, makes him the chieftain of the Gael tribe (hers and Arthur's father was the previous chieftain, but Arthur could not assume the title due to being the First Warrior).

As the prologue ends, point of view is switched from Rhiannon to Arawn, revealing him to be the protagonist of the game, and the story continues with the exodus of Gael tribe to the neighboring island of Albion (or Insula Britannica, as shown on an in-game map) in hope of eluding the Empire.",2005-04-28 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

The Foot is defeated, and Master Splinter mysteriously disappears. The Turtles chase the trail down to a building marked ""T.C.R.I."", which proves to hide a bizarre secret beneath its innocuous exterior: its employees are members of a brain-like alien race, the Utroms. Whilst battling these strange new foes, the Turtles are accidentally teleported to different points across the galaxy, meeting the Fugitoid Professor Honeycutt on D'Hoonib, and end up as crossfire in the war between the Triceratons and Federation - both sides are after the Fugitoid for his technology. Along the way, they come across an intergalactic bounty hunter named Slashuur. Said to be the most powerful bounty hunter in the universe, Honeycutt heard legends of him as a young child. Ironically, Honeycutt is who Slashuur is after, having been hired by the Triceratons to capture him. After the Turtles beat him, Slashuur reveals that he has knowledge of Hamato Yoshi before taking his leave. Before escaping the Triceraton Homeworld, the Turtles befriend and free a noble Triceraton warrior who had been forced to fight as a gladiator, Traximus.

Upon returning to Earth and the T.C.R.I. building, it is revealed that the Utroms had rescued an injured Splinter and were caring for him. The Utroms place the TMNT and Splinter in a virtual reality machine to better explain their origins to them. Hundreds of years ago, the Utroms were traveling across the galaxy, transporting a murderous rogue of their species, Ch'rell. Their ship crashes on Earth in the country of Japan. Ch'rell escapes, while the Utroms are forced to wait for Earth technology to catch up with their own, so they can return home. Some time later, after the Utroms have enlisted the help of some humans as Guardian Ninja, the Utroms are ambushed by a heavily armored warlord known as The Shredder. Meanwhile, in the real world, Baxter Stockman sabotages the virtual reality machine, and the dangers within become presented as real to the Turtles and Splinter. After defeating Shredder and his Feudal Foot Ninja, the Turtle meet up with the Utrom Mortu, who gives them a device that allows them to return to the real world. Unfortunately, when they get there, they find Shredder and the Foot attacking the T.C.R.I. building. During their fight, an organic destruction device is planted, and the Utrom escape through their Transmat.

Leatherhead came into contact with some Retromutagen Ooze, and became as he is currently, just as the Turtles had. He lived with the Utroms, considering them his family. When the T.C.R.I. building exploded, he fled to the sewers and took up residence in the Turtles' old lair, attempting to build a Transmat of his own to follow the Utroms. Unfortunately, it is revealed that his partner in this endeavor was none other than Baxter Stockman, feigning alliance with the Utroms. Baxter, realizing his jig was up, threw a chemical tank and fled, causing the ceiling of Leatherhead's lair to collapse.

168562,1246,Tekken 5,"After the conclusion of The King of Iron Fist Tournament 4, an intense battle between father and son, Kazuya and Jin, took place at Hon-Maru in the Mishima Zaibatsu headquarters. Jin emerged as the victor, and Heihachi turned his back on Kazuya and said.

""What a pathetic wretch... You worthless coward!""

The battle between Heihachi and Jin began. Jin defeated Heihachi. Filled with anger, his black wings spread, Just as Heihachi thought he was doomed, Jin regained control of himself.

""Thank my mother, Jun Kazama."" Jin said as he took flight.

The sounds of battle gave way to silence as Heihachi lay spread out on the ground. The silence was soon interrupted by approaching aircraft. The roar of the aircraft increased and the sound of something being ejected was heard. A group of Jack-4s crashed through the ceiling. At first, Heihachi suspected that Kazuya was responsible for the intrusion but realized that Kazuya was just as bewildered by the sudden attack.

""Why are you here?"" tells Heihachi as the wave of Jack 4s approaches. Heihachi and Kazuya team up and battle waves of Jack 4s but reinforcements appear as fast as the Jacks are destroyed.

Heihachi starts to lose his breath. Kazuya then betrays Heihachi, throwing him into the middle of the army of Jacks, and uses the opportunity to escape from Honmaru. Shortly after, Honmaru is devastated by a huge explosion and Heihachi goes flying, landing in a graveyard

On an airplane close by, the battle is watched by a man dressed in black. He raises his hand to his ear and speaks into his radio.

""Heihachi Mishima is dead...""

At that moment, a Jack attacks from behind but it cut in half instantly as the man disappears.

Hon-Maru is completely destroyed, a raging inferno in its place. A pile of debris was blown apart as something emerged from the earth, unseen.

The next day, news of Heihachi Mishima's death spread rapidly across the globe. Most people believed that Heihachi's death would bring about the end of the Mishima Zaibatsu, but behind the scenes someone else had taken control, and business went on as usual.

A month later, it was announced that the Mishima Zaibatsu will hold The King of Iron Fist Tournament 5.",2004-11-30 00:00:00.000,51,NULL,90.0000,4,81.1795,187

Kazuya Mishima and Jin Kazama fight an epic father-son duel at Honmaru, of the Mishima Zaibatsu. When the dust settles, Jin is victorious. Disgusted, Heihachi Mishima turns his back on Kazuya.

""Was that the best you could do? Pathetic! You deserve to die.""

A duel ensues between Heihachi and Jin... Jin sprouts black wings and goes berserk with rage, proving to be more than a match for Heihachi. Jin, however, regains his senses just before dealing the lethal blow.

""Be thankful for Jun Kazama...my mother.""

Saying this, he flies off, leaving Honmaru behind. Heihachi is drained and defeated and lies sprawled on the ground. Once again, the battleground is silent.

However, the silence is short-lived. Soon the sound of an aircraft can be heard approaching. The buzz grows to a roar, and something can be heard launching from the craft. A hoard of Jacks suddenly burst through the ceiling, invading the compound.

At first Heihachi thinks that Kazuya has orchestrated the invasion. Kazuya, however, is roused by the rumbling and shaking, and obviously doesn't know what is going on either.

""Who are you?!""

Just as Heihachi shouts, the Jacks attack both of them. Heihachi and Kazuya are forced to fight together and begin destroying the Jacks. However, for every Jack they wreck, two more seem to take its place. Just as Heihachi begins to show signs of fatigue, Kazuya betrays him, hurling him into the midst of their enemies.

""Nnnoooooooo!!! Kazuyaaaaaa!!!""

Ignoring Heihachi's screams, Kazuya escapes Hon-maru while the enemies are distracted. Immediately afterward, Honmaru erupts in a massive explosion and is annihilated. A man cloaked in black silently watches the explosion.

Placing his hand on his ear, he checks his transmission signal and reports: ""Heihachi Mishima is dead...""

Immediately after his transmission, a single Jack attacks him from behind, but is obliterated with a single stroke of the man's blade.

With that, the man vanishes.

Desolated and in flames, all traces of Hon-maru have been destroyed. No one remains to witness the creature that bursts out of the ground amidst the rubble.

The following day the world learns of the death of Heihachi Mishima, leader of the Mishima Zaibatsu. This should have marked the end of the Mishima Zaibatsu, but a mysterious figure assumes leadership of the organization, restoring order to it as if nothing has occurred.

One month passes...

177654,1035,The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,"One year, in celebration of when the Picori last came to Hyrule 100 years ago to the day, the festival was unusually grand. Hyrule Castle was hosting a tournament of sword-fighting skill that calls to mind the heroes of legend. That year’s champion was a mysterious man by the name of Vaati. He won the tournament with an almost magical ease, and all of Hyrule was abuzz with rumors about this shadowy figure. The young Link, who attends the festival that year with his childhood friend, Princess Zelda, is charged by his grandfather, Smith, with delivering the sword that will be presented to the champion.

During the ceremony following the sword competition, Vaati shatters the sacred Picori Blade and opens the Bound Chest, which, for an age, had been sealed by the Picori Blade, trapping evil monsters within. Vaati is after the Light Force, the golden light that was once wielded by the Hero of Men mentioned in the legends of the Picori. He subdues the castle guards and turns Princess Zelda to stone before departing. Vaati was once a Minish, an apprentice of the Minish sage Ezlo. Ezlo had made a magical Cap with the power to grant wishes, but Vaati had stolen it and used it to become a powerful sorcerer. He had transformed Ezlo into a hat himself, then proceeded to hunt down the Light Force. Link is asked by King Daltus to seek out the Picori and ask them to reforge the sacred blade, and he travels to the Minish Woods with the help of his Map.

There he meets Ezlo, a curious creature whom he rescues from a group of Red Octoroks. Ezlo hops onto his head and offers to help him find the Picori. He also helps Link shrink down to a minuscule size — the size of the Picori people, who call themselves the Minish. Link meets with Gentari, the elder of the Minish Village, who tells him that in order to reforge the sacred Picori Blade, he will need the Four Elements, the embodiment of the sacred powers of earth, fire, water, and wind. Vaati had learned from the legend of the Wind Tribe that when the Four Elements were collected, the path to the Light Force will open. Knowing that Link is collecting them, Vaati decides to wait until the task is complete.

Once Link has gathered the Four Elements, he brings the Picori Blade — renamed the White Sword by Melari, a Minish sword-smith — to the Elemental Sanctuary hidden within the courtyard of Hyrule Castle. There he infuses the White Sword with the Four Elements, fully restoring the sacred Four Sword — a legendary blade with the power to split one warrior into four. Link then gains access to a chamber with stained glass, where the location of the Light Force is revealed to be within Princess Zelda.

Meanwhile, Vaati has brainwashed King Daltus and shrouded Hyrule Castle in darkness. He discovers from the stained glass of the chamber inside the Elemental Sanctuary that the sacred Light Force had actually been passed down through Hyrule’s princesses, and so he prepares to extract it from Princess Zelda. Link rushes to her rescue, and, after vanquishing Vaati, uses the Four Sword’s evil-banishing power to restore Princess Zelda.

With Vaati defeated, the Mage's Cap could be used to restore Hyrule. Princess Zelda puts on the cap and wishes with all her heart that Vaati’s cruelty might be undone. With her righteous wish and the power of the Light Force that still dwelt within her, many miracles happen as a result.

Now that the land of the humans had been saved, Ezlo ventures back into the world of the Minish through the Minish Door, not to return until perhaps the next time, one hundred years later, when the doorway to their world would open once more.",2004-11-04 00:00:00.000,90,NULL,90.0000,1,84.1893,292

Fortunately, the player finds a gas station. The player takes their car into the garage. At that point the player takes control. The player is introduced to a vehicle mechanic named Oscar who, after a brief tutorial in teaching the player how to talk to NPC Sims, informs the player their car will only take a short while to fix.

The player is then free to roam around the gas station, and after being introduced to some more NPCs, including Bella Goth, who claims to be abducted by aliens, completing tasks and being taught the basic objective of the game which is ""Secret Hunting"" for the store clerk. The player then exits the shop only to find the garage around the back has completely disappeared along with Oscar and their car, with only the foundation of the garage remaining. The only thing left from the disappearance is a cell phone, which the player answers and a man named Doctor Dominic Newlow offers the player a job, requiring him or her to get a ride into town and find a place to stay.

The player informs Police Deputy Duncan about the situation who replies that he can do nothing about it and suggests the player find a place to stay. After having bought Bella's house for pocket change and getting donuts for Deputy Duncan (which happen to have been found in the trash), the player finally gets a lift into Strangetown's Paradise Place, only to find more tasks and mysteries.",2005-12-07 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
9486,224,The Sims 2,"The game starts at the neighborhood level. Here you can create a housing development from scratch or start with one of three pre-made neighborhoods, each with its own theme. From there, you'll settle on a house and a family of Sims to control. Sims now have aspirations, wants, and fears. The wants and fears are the day-to-day things that occupy their minds, like wanting to see friends or get married and fearing death or being rejected for a kiss. Satisfy their wants, and they become more efficient at completing tasks you assign them. Realize their fears, and Sims become lethargic, cranky, and unresponsive to your commands. Aspirations are the big-picture things, like raising a family, becoming wealthy, and gaining knowledge. Succeed here and you'll be able to buy odd gifts for your Sim to improve his or her life, like a money tree that pays dividends or a ""fountain of youth"" water cooler.

Of course, you wouldn't be able to juggle all that if it weren't for the improved ""Free Will"" option, which makes it easier for Sims to fulfill their basic needs. The artificial intelligence of the game is noticeably improved; they won't turn on radios just as a family member is going to bed but, strangely, they do occasionally put their dishes on the floor.

Another big change in the series is the concept of the lifespan. Now Sims are born with the traits of their parents, families grow, and Sims grow old. Not only does this go hand in hand with aspirations (growing up is the first aspiration that a baby Sim will have), it provides a limited time with which your Sims can achieve their goals.

Several years after the end of the war, a crime organization called Vischio has taken control of the destroyed city of Toshima (formerly Tokyo, Japan's capital city), where they are holding a battle game known as Igura.

Igura is a battle game held in Toshima that may result in the murder of participants. To participate, one must meet with Arbitro and tell him their reason for their decision. Upon meeting with Arbitro, participants are given five dog tags, each engraved like a card in a standard deck of playing cards. One tag must hang from the participant's neck as proof of participation. Participants must then put their lives on the line to collect others' tags, with the goal being to collect a Royal Flush. If a participant collects a Royal Flush set of tags, they earn the right to challenge ""Il Re"" in battle. Battles end when one party either dies or lets their back touch the ground. The winner takes the loser's tags and is free to do as they please to the loser after that, often resulting in the loser's death.

The game's main character, a young man named Akira, is falsely accused of a crime. Once arrested, a mysterious woman appears before him, offering him freedom if he agrees to participate in Igura and defeat Igura's strongest man: the king, or Il Re. The story follows Akira's life in the harsh, lawless Toshima as he fights both to survive and to unravel the mysteries developing around him.",2005-02-25 00:00:00.000,2,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

187988,21441,Tokyo Xtreme Racer Drift 2,"The story is set one year after Kaido Battle 2: Chain Reaction and before Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3, as that's when the Thirteen Devils broke up.

Intro :

The ""Kaido Circuit"" extends throughout Japan. High-speed battles unfold as drivers enter all kinds of races, seeking to test themselves. Striving for the top, racers battle one another day after day.

At night, the dark side of the Circuit emerges: a private world known only to racers, where ""Survival of the Fittest"" is the only rule. Gossip leads to rumors, and rumors grow into the stiff of legend...

One such legendary racer once existed. He was called the Emotional King, a veritable god in the Kaido World. However, they say that he suddenly vanished after a race in Aso...

With the Emotional King gone from the Kaido night scene, two dominant figures emerged: Absolute Emperor and Miracles Summit.

They came from Category Races and were already ""legitimate"" racers. These 2 are now rumored to be the best that Kaido has to offer.

Then a legendary metropolitan team, The Thirteen Devils, apparently took it upon themselves to stem the flow of metropolitan racers crossing over into Kaido.

Can anyone defeat the Absolute Emperor and Miracles Summit?

What has become of the Emotional King?

Has the Kaido Circuit really been overrun by the Thirteen Devils?

And where is the next legendary racer?

As the battle begins, a team has been formed to fight against the 13 Devils: Kingdom Twelve, whom their leader's real identity is mysterious.

In the meantime, all Slashers (Stage 1 : MMC Ooaza and World Supremacy, Stage 2 : Haruna Guardian, Lonely Wanderer and Metal Wizard, Stage 3 : Final Leg, New Moon and Global Winner) and the double aces Yeti Fang and Murder Supremacy are preparing themselves as the 13 Devils may eventually challenge them.

While everyone is ready, the player arrives and defeats every Slashers who ask if he/she would join them against the 13 Devils. Meanwhile, after Global Winner's defeat, Kyoichi Imaizumi (Yeti Fang) and Tastu Zoshigaya (Supremacy Murder), described as 2 witnesses of the last battle, discuss about that battle :

""What did you think of that battle?""

""Hmm... He races rough, but still fast. He's obviously not from the racing circuit...""

""Yeah, I agree. He came here on his own, and he's out to battle us now. We've got nowhere left to run. All we can do now is accept his challenge.""

""Fine. I'll make it perfectly clear who the better racer is. My technique is tempered by experience, it's unbeatable. What I want to know is, where did he come from..?""

Then, both the Kingdom Twelve and the Thirteen Devils are being defeated one by one. Meanwhile, a person begins to doubt about the Kingdom's objective as it seems that the leaders are strangely friendly. Furthermore, after the player defeats Timber Slash, the identity of Kingdom Twelve's leader is revealed by her: Hamagaki, the former Emotional King, AKA Kaido President. Apparently, he lost against Kokami just before Zoshigaya beat him.

As both the Absolute Emperor and Miracles Summit were defeated, a new course has been opened : Hokkaido, where only the best drivers are there. By reading the messages, the player can see that the 13 Devils' leader is here : Motoya Iwasaki, AKA Speed King, and some legend drivers are here, such as God Shift Bunta, the High Empress (former Lovers' leader) and someone who drives a black and red Lancer Evolution III but no one can remember his identity.

When the Empress is defeated, the real goal of the Kingdom Twelve is revealed by her as she was recruited by Hamagaki, but declined his offer : ""Kingdom Twelve's ostensible goal is to get all the Tokyo racers and all the highway racers under their thumb. Then, once they've conquered the highways, they'll transform into the ultimate rally team and make a new start"", meaning that Hamagaki wants to build his own ""racing utopia"".

As Kaido President and Speed King are defeated, the black and red Lancer Evolution III is revealed to be the long lost Emotional King : Taiju Kokami, who wanted to make a fresh start as Emotional King. After his defeat, a new team shows up after the great battle : Revival Of Sodom, lead by Zaiga Koshigaya, who appears to have known Kokami for a long time as he was his friend. Even though Zoshigaya is one of the best drivers, he lost to them, so everyone asked if the player can do something about them as the new legendary racer.",2005-07-28 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,60.0000,1,NULL,NULL

After completing his goal to recreate the stars in the sky, the King of All Cosmos was surprised to discover that he had many fans down on Earth. Thus begins We Love Katamari, where the King of All Cosmos seeks to help fulfill the wishes of his fans—with the help from his son and his son's cousins, who again travel Earth, rolling things up into a Katamari.

The King of All Cosmos’s origin:
The King of All Cosmos's history is told in We Love Katamari’s cut scenes, interspersed between the game’s stages.
The King of All Cosmos was not always the King. His father was the previous King of All Cosmos (also called Emperor of the Cosmos, or Papa). The future King of All Cosmos grew up either on Earth itself or a planet very much like it, in a giant castle on a hill surrounded by green fields. (Though, early in the game, we are to believe all action takes place in a world called “The Great Cosmos”.)",2005-07-06 00:00:00.000,10,NULL,89.3333,3,87.5722,28

As heroes investigated Onyxia's manipulations, the ancient elemental lord Ragnaros resurfaced to endanger both the Horde and Alliance.[42] The heroes of the Horde and Alliance defeated Onyxia and sent Ragnaros back to the Elemental Plane.

Assault on Blackwing Lair
Deep within Blackrock Mountain, the black dragon Nefarian conducted twisted experiments with the blood of other dragonflights. Intent on seizing the entire area for his own, he recruited the remaining Dark Horde, a rogue army that embraced the demonic bloodlust of the old Horde. These corrupt orcs, trolls, and other races battled against Ragnaros and the Dark Iron dwarves for control of the mountain. Nefarian created the twisted chromatic dragons and a legion of other aberrations in his bid to form an army powerful enough to control Azeroth and continue the legacy of his infamous father, Deathwing the Destroyer. Nefarian was vanquished by the heroes from the Horde and the Alliance.

Rise of the Blood God
Years ago, in the ruined temple of Atal'Hakkar, loyal priests of the Blood God Hakkar the Soulflayer attempted to summon the wrathful deity's avatar into the world. But his followers, the Atal'ai priesthood, discovered that the Soulflayer could only be summoned within the Gurubashi tribe's ancient capital, Zul'Gurub. Newly reborn in this jungle fortress, Hakkar took control of the Gurubashi tribe and mortal champions of the trolls' mighty animal gods. The Soulflayer's dark influence was halted when the Zandalari tribe recruited heroes and invaded Zul'Gurub.

The Gates of Ahn'Qiraj
The great desert fortress of Ahn'Qiraj, long sealed behind the Scarab Wall, was home to the insectoid qiraji, a savage race that had once mounted an assault to devastate the continent of Kalimdor. But something far more sinister lurked behind Ahn'Qiraj's walls: the Old God C'Thun, an ancient entity whose pervasive evil had suffused Azeroth since time immemorial. As C'Thun incited the qiraji to frenzy, both the Alliance and Horde prepared for a massive war effort. A mixed force of Alliance and Horde soldiers, dubbed the Might of Kalimdor, opened the gates of Ahn'Qiraj under the command of the orc Varok Saurfang. The heroes laid siege to the ruins and temples of Ahn'Qiraj and vanquished C'Thun.

Shadow of the Necropolis
In the Lich King's haste to spread the plague of undeath over Azeroth, he gifted one of his greatest servants, the lich Kel'Thuzad, with the flying citadel of Naxxramas, as a base of operations for the Scourge. Consistent attacks from the Scarlet Crusade and Argent Dawn factions weakened the defenses of the floating fortress, enabling an incursion from the heroes that led to Kel'Thuzad's defeat. However, a traitor among the ranks of the knightly order of the Argent Dawn ran away with Kel'Thuzad's cursed remains and fled to Northrend, where the fallen lich could be reanimated.",2004-11-23 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

An up-and-coming scholar named Charlotte L. Wells has had her interest piqued by this local legend and desperately wishes to study it in person—but of course, Harlech Island is no place for an unescorted young lady. To aid her in her investigation, therefore, she enlists the help of an old childhood friend and fallen knight who agrees to accompany her on this adventure.

Arriving in Harlech and catching sight of Castle Strangerock almost immediately, Char dives into researching the mystery head-on, leaving her companion to explore the surrounding environs on his own in search of any artifacts that might help trace the origins of this ephemeral stronghold.

Sadly, this almost immediately leads to his death at the hands of a mysterious swordsman seemingly displaced in time...but death is to be only the beginning of his adventure.""",2005-06-24 00:00:00.000,3,NULL,82.8333,8,74.8684,5

186471,18689,Yume Nikki,"The story of Yume Nikki is mostly up to the player's interpretation. All we know for sure is that Madotsuki, the game's silent protagonist, lives alone in her apartment which she refuses to leave and which contains a desk, a single Famicom game console, a balcony, and, most importantly, a bed. Upon going to bed, Madotsuki explores her dreams, a surreal world full of illogically connected, smaller worlds to gather ""effects."" What exactly these dreams and effects represent in Madotsuki's personal life is, again, up to interpretation. Even Madotsuki's name, a name that isn't a real name in Japan, is entirely up to interpretation.",2004-06-26 00:00:00.000,17,NULL,NULL,NULL,77.1107,53
